# QSSS
This is the repository for my QSSS senior thesis.

# Known issues:
## Script:
- Abbreviations not to split on (like 'etc.' 'vs.' 'i.e.') are currently hard-coded
## Tagging/Coding:
- Defining new variable = MethDef?
- Model selection method and metrics = MethJust? New tag?
- "Our client wants us to..." = RQSig?
- Last sentence in the report = RQSig or IntImp?
- Discard section titles?
