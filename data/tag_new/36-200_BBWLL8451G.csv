Forest fires comprise a major concern for worldwide nations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Their occurrences can cause serious harm to economic development and ecological condition as well as endangerment of both humans and animals (as reported by Cortez and Morais, 2007)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to the severity of consequences, prevention and containment of forest fires are of viral importance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This report aims to promote a better understanding on forest fires as a whole and other factors associated with forest fires,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this way, it may help environment policy makers and forest rangers to better prevent forest fires and minimize damage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dataset used in this report focuses on the Montesinho natural park and is collected from January 2000 to December 2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is integrated and presented by Cortez and Morais (2007), with the first database being collected by the inspector of Montesinho fire occurrences and the second database being collected by the Braganca Polytechnic Institute",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It has a sample of 517 forest fire cases and contains variables like total burnt area, date, and other features",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This research has a primary focus on the variable area, a quantitative variable that denotes the total area burnt in a forest fire and is measured in hectares (ha)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As shown in table 1, the mean area is 12.895 ha and the median area is 0.52 ha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The distribution of area as shown in figure 1 is unimodal with the mode occurring between 0 and 9.99,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mode is right skewed with several outliers that have extremely high values up to about 1090 ha, thus explaining the great difference between mean and median",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Other variables covered in the research questions include month, initial spread index (ISI), and outside relative humidity (RH)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The categorical variable month indicates the month of the year that the forest fire happened,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the bar chart indicating distribution of month (figure 2), it can be seen that August has a conspicuously large count of forest fire (184 out of 517 forest fires occurred, forming a 35.6%) and that September has a slightly lower count than August (172 out of 517 forest fires occurred, forming a 33.3%)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The quantitative variable ISI denotes a numeric value estimating the rate of fire spread,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As seen in table 2, the ISI values for this dataset range from 0 to about 56",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mean ISI is roughly 9 and the median ISI is 8.4, which is slightly lower than the mean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The last variable included in the research questions is RH, which is a measurement of the humidity when the forest fire occurred and is measured in percentage (%)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"According to the following figure 3, the distribution of RH in the dataset is bimodal, with the modes occurring at 25-29 and around 40",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Research Scenarios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Describing the Distribution of the Month of Forest Fire Occurrence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first question in this report focuses on characterizing the month of forest fire occurrence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the common knowledge that forest fires are related to hot and dry weather, we hypothesize that most of the forest fires occurred during summer, which is defined as the third quarter of the year and spans from June to August",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Referring back to figure 3, we can observe directly that August and September have conspicuously higher counts than other months",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Number of counts in September is slightly lower than number of counts in August, and these two counts presumably add up to the majority of counts in the entire year",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"June and July, which are the other two months referred to in the research question, have conspicuously lower counts than August and September",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These two counts are between 0 and 50, roughly the same level with counts in the rest of the months",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To further summarize the data with table 3, we observe that June has 17 counts, which comprise only about 3.3% of the sample size. Similarly, July has 32 counts that comprise roughly 6.2% and August has 184 counts that comprise roughly 35.6% of all counts of forest fires",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We then compute that counts of the three months add up to 233, which accounts for about 45.1% of all counts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus number of forest fires in Summer does not exceed half of the number in one year,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our hypothesis is refuted by the evidence,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total Burnt Area Dependent on Initial Spread Index,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second research question in our report is whether there is a relationship between total burnt area and the initial spread index,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since ISI indicates the spread rate of a forest fire, it is reasonable to hypothesize that there is a positive relationship between area and ISI",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, we start with mapping a scatterplot with ISI as the x-axis and area as the y-axis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Then we model a linear regression line to observe the possible linear relationship between the two quantitative variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the following figure 4, we observe that the the distribution is slightly right skewed with several outliers that have either extremely high ISI or area, such as the point with an ISI of 56.1 and an area of 0.1ha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The relationship does not exhibit a very clear linearity but can be recognized as reasonably linear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is slight increase in area as ISI increases,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To further identify the relationship between ISI and area, we can model simple linear regression between the the two variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The regression line has an y-intercept of approximately 11.86ha and a slope of 0.1149, which denotes a rather mild positive relationship between the two variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From these evidences, we can say that there’s a weak but slightly positive linear relationship between ISI and area",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus the second research hypothesis is confirmed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Total Burnt Area Dependent on Outside Relative Humidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last question in our report is to investigate whether total burnt area is associated with outside relative humidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to our common knowledge that it is easier for forest fires to expand in dry condition, it is reasonable to assume that there is a negative relationship between RH and area",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, we generate a scatterplot with RH on the x-axis and area on the y-axis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A linear regression line is also modeled to help identify and characterize the relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The distribution is right skewed with several extremely high RH values reaching up to 100%,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are also two outliers for area, which are about 746ha and 1091ha",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Generally the relationship looks reasonably linear with the majority of 480 cases falling into the area of 0-15ha,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To further examine the linear relationship, we observe from the following table 5 that the simple regression line has an y-intercept of about 25.9ha and a slope of about -0.3",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This means that as RH increases, the corresponding area decreases by 0.3 percent of RH change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In this case we can say that the relationship between RH and area is reasonably linear with a slightly negative slope,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus this evidence supports our hypothesis and further proves the negative correlation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This report centers around the general subject of forest fires,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It examines the month of forest fire occurrence and investigates potential relationship between area and two other factors of initial spread index and outside relative humidity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All investigations are established on a sample of 517 forest fire cases on the Montesinho natural park,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In general, we found that most forest fires occur in August and September, but the reason behind this finding is not clear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We then discovered a weak relationship with a slightly positive slope between ISI and area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eventually, between RH and area, we discovered a linear relationship with slightly negative slope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The relationship seen between RH an area is stronger than the relationship seen between ISI and area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are certain limitations in this research, which include that the dataset is from a specific region and thus lacks randomness in sampling and that this report lacks diversity in summary and graphing measures due to variable types employed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Future studies can investigate forest fires within a more globalized range and use more diverse variables along with more summary measures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Eventually, this report may help policy makers and rangers to better prevent and control forest fires, thus avoiding loss due to forest fires",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
