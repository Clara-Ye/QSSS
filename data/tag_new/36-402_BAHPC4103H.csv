Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Preston Jorgensen would like to know from research if there is any factors that appear to be related to lifespan to attain immortality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given data set from The AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity which contains 347 observations of 14 variables from AnAge for animals in the Chordata phylum including animals with spinal cords, we will answer the following three questions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First, we will find evidence, if any, that if slowing the metabolic rate would increase the life span",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then, we will observe the relationship of metabolic rate and lifespan to determine if there is a nonlinear relationship between the two with and without transformation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, we will use modeled estimate to find if crab-eating raccoon would be a good company during Preston's immortality with a 50% smaller metabolic rate (1)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dataset we use in this research is from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity which is a “curated database of age-ing and life history in animals” that was “primarily developed for comparative biology studies”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For each species in the data table, we have the following variables: HAGRID (the Human Ageing Genomic Resources ID), Kingdom (along with phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species), common name, maximum longevity (lifespan) in years, typical adult body mass in grams, typical resting metabolic rate in Watts, and typical body temperature in Kelvin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The dataset is composed of following variables name: `HAGRID`, `Kingdom`, `Phylum`, `Class`, `Order`, `Family`, `Genus`, `Species`, `Common.name`, `Maximum.longevity.yrs`, `Body.mass.g`, `Metabolic.rate`, and `Temperature` (2)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After statistical analysis conducted on the data set we have using two key variables, the maximum longevity and metabolic rate, we may conclude that lifespan increases as metabolic rate decreases (meaning they have negative relationship), the two variables have non-linear relationship, and decreasing the metabolic rate of the crab-eating raccoon by 50% would increase its lifespan by 2.34173 years (3)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before we look into the data, we first create a new variable called `Metabolic.by.mass` in which divides metabolic rate (`Metabolic.rate`) by body mass (`Body.mass.g`) for each observations",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will use this variable throughout the report instead of metabolic rate (`Metabolic.rate`) to indicate amount of energy used per unit of body mass which allows us to compare between animals of different sizes (1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Next, we will look into two key variables: Metabolic Rate by Mass in (`Metabolic.by.mass`) and Maximum Longevity in years (`Maximum.longevity.yrs`)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Metabolic Rate by Mass in W/g (`Metabolic.by.mass`) has mean of 4.405e-03 W/g, median of 3.023e-03 W/g and range of 4.543e-05 W/g to 4.143e-02 W/g",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we see in the histogram in Figure 1, the data points are heavily skewed to the right as we see few outliers as well to the right side of the graph",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, we see majority of the points fall in the range of 0 W/g and 0.01 W/g",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The second key value that we look into is Maximum Longevity in years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The variable has mean of 16.01 years, median of 12.90 years and range of 2.50 years to 122.50 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similar to the first variable we examined, Maximum Longevity also is right skewed as we see the histogram in Figure 2, we observe that there are few outliers as well to the right side of the graph",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, we see majority of points fall in range of 0 years to 30 years (2)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With that being said, we want to examine the relationship between the two key variables: Metabolic Rate and Maximum Longevity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since we want to see how Maximum Longevity changes depending on different values of Metabolic Rate, we notify that Maximum Longevity to be our response variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We may claim that the data points have close to normal distribution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
but skewed to the right (3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the key variables we explored, lets find the relationship of the two variables using scatter plot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we stated above, we will set Maximum Longevity as our response variable while we set Metabolic rate by mass as our predictor variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Figure 5, we examine that the plot is hard to be interpreted due to excessive amount of points clustered in the corner of the graph",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, we apply log transformation to make the graph more clear to understand, so that we can see the relationship of the two variables more clearly In order to apply log transformation to the two variables, we will create two new variables in our dataset called `Log.max.Longevity`, which are values of logarithm applied to `Maximum.longevity.yrs`, and `Log.Metabolic.by.mass`, which are values of logarithm applied to `Metabolic.by.mass`",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 6 shows the result of log-transformation on the two variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now, we see the data points are spread out which makes easier for us to find the relationship",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Cluster of points we can see in Figure 5 is gone and distributions are flattened throughout the transformation (5),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to such benefits through log-transformation, we will be using them for the rest of the analysis (4)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we observe the scatterplot carefully, we find the overall trend of the graph is negative slope with linear relationship, with some outliers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The datapoints overall are a bit spread out which gives a slight randomness, but still gives strong evidence of negative and linear relationship",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In our later analysis, we will probably find the relationship of the two variables to be the following: as predictor variable (Metabolic by mass) increases, response variable (Maximum Longevity) would decrease (6)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To begin, we construct a linear model to predict using the two variables: `Maximum.longevity.yrs` and `Metabolic.by.mass`",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will be using log-transformed data points in order to make our analysis easier as we showed in EDA step,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The linear model we create is the following: log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) = $beta_{0}$ + $beta_{1}$log(Metabolic.by.mass) (1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Using R, we find out that $beta_{0}$ has value of 0.1492 and $beta_{1}$ has value of -0.39993",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus, our linear model is the following: log(Maximum.longevity.yrs) = 0.1492 + -0.39993log(Metabolic.by.mass)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also find that the p-value of Beta 1 is very small and the adjusted r-squared value is 0.3401, showing the fit is reasonable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will use MSE to further compare the linear model with spline models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will use more sophisticated and flexible model, smoothing spline to observe the trend and relationship further",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will be creating five models with effective degrees of freedom being 3 to 7 (2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Below in Table 1, we show the MSE for the linear model and all of the spline models with ten-fold cross validation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As we see from the table, spline model with degrees of freedom being 7 is the best model out of all the models with its MSE error being 0.3573843, which is the lowest MSE error out of all models we observe (3)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Keep in mind that the difference bewteen the highest MSE error and the lowest MSE error is about 0.1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We observe that the model we chose performs about 3% better than the worst model, indicating the difference between the models are not significant (5)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have presented model diagnostic plot in Figure 7 for the spline model with degrees of freedom being 7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The model appears to fit well for few reasons,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Figure 7, the residuals are mostly centered around zero, having distribution above and below the zero line as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
QQ-plot in Figure 8 also does not indicate any particular assumption violation as there is no noticeable divergence in the plot,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, we may safely say the model fits well with no particular assumption violated (4)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the chosen spline model with degrees of freedom being 7, it seems like non-parametric bootstrapping is an appropriate choice since the method re-samples the original data and is also well-known for having no assumptions about the distribution of data it is being applied to (6)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To answer Preston Jorgensen's question, whether animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, we take a look into Figure 9",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The graph uses the fitted values for the selected (best) model against logged Metabolic Rate by Mass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We observe that the fitted values have negative correlation with the logged Metabolic Rate by Mass,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words, as logged Metabolic Rate by Mass increases, the value of logged Maximum Longevity decreases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, relationship of the two variables without any transformation also shows the same pattern as we can see in Figure 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, to answer Preston Jorgensen's question, animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans (1)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We note that the relationship of both transformed and non-transformed data of the two variables are not linear, which is the reason why we choose spline models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Next, we answer other question Preston addresses by looking at crab-eating raccoon data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the output of crab-eating racoon data tells us, the lifespan is 19 years with 0.002231 W/g average metabolic by mass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we take 50% of the average metabolic by mass, we get 0.0011155 W/g",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We apply logarithm to the value of the reduced metabolic by mass value and put it into our Spline model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Then, the logged value of lifespan comes out to be 21.34173 years after we get rid of log from the result (2)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The value increased the lifespan of crab-eating raccoon by 2.34173 years, which indicates a significant change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Using bootstrapping, we can make a 95% confidence interval for the value we got to see if its a significant change or not",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will be using 1000 bootstrap iterations to create confidence interval, which comes out ot be [20.22214 22.53236] (3)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We notice that 21.34173 falls in the range of confidence interval, indicating the reduction in metabolic rate leads to lifespan increase",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Above all, we examined the relationship between Metabolic Rate by Mass and lifespan of animal species to answer the questions addressed earlier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to answer them, we applied transformation to data points in order to interpret them easily in use of modeling",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In conclusion, we find, with the help of smoothing spline model and linear model, that the two key variables are negatively related as lifespan increases while metabolic rate decreases (1)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the results above, we may conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to increase",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We observe that the lifespan changed from 19 to 21.34173 years, difference of 2.34173 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We find this change significant as well (2),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although we showed that our chosen model with certain degrees of freedom does not seem to violate any assumptions that would make the result certain, we may not completely trust the model we have since we only use one variable, Metabolic Rate by Mass, to find out its effect to lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There could be other factors that contribute to change of lifespan and therefore we may not assume that the only variable that changes lifespan is Metabolic Rate by Mass (3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
