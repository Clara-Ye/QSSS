Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the world continues to transform into a generation of digitally-centered people, social platforms are beginning to grasp the time and attention of many: YouTube being a popular choice. Better yet, videos posted on YouTube are becoming monetized (even unwillingly now according to the Nov.18.2020 Forbes article : https://www.forbes.com /sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/18/youtube-will-now-show-ads-on-all-videos-even-if-creators-dont-want-them/?sh=6faeaaa54913) , and creators strive to push out content in hopes to attain higher views per video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, it is of our interest to research further into what factors may contribute to these higher, or lower view counts",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This should not only help YouTubers gain an understanding of ways to increase view counts but could also help YouTube improve their algorithm in suggesting videos to different viewers across the world,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The dataset consists of 1,259 channels from YouTube, sampled until the end of 2018 by Social Blade",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will mainly take a look at the relationship of the number of views per video and the channel topic at hand,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of views per video is a quantitative measurement of how many views each video records, on average, for each channel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When calculated across all channels, the mean was 2,960,682 views per video with a standard deviation of 8,332,162 as displayed in the figure below",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our research will contain other variables including the number of subscribers and the channel category,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The number of subscribers is a quantitative indicator that represents the number of active users engaging with the channel platform,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The overall mean value across all channels was 3,201,758 subscribers with a standard deviation of 3,556,605",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, when breaking it down by the categorical variable of channel category, we notice that the “Comedy” category takes lead with a mean subscriber count of 4,458,965 and standard deviation of 4,552,600",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In contrast, the lowest mean is recorded in “News & Politics” as 2,008,807 subscribers with a standard deviation of 1,477,641",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will further discuss and analyze why these numbers make sense in the following research portion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will first analyze how views per video vary across the given data set,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We are able to predict that with the exception of a few channels that may have continuously “viral” content and record an exceptionally high count, most videos will fall under 20 million views per video",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When taking a look at Figure 1, which displays the distribution of the views per video, the most notable feature is the shape",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The distribution is clearly skewed right (tail located on the right side), with a few outliers located at the higher end of views per video (for example, at ~75M, ~85M, and ~215M)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The mode of the data is in the first bar which contains the range of 4500-5.2871M where 1,094 videos out of 1,259 channels (86.89% of the total channels)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The median number of views per video we also found was 1,030,668, much lower than that of the mean that was recorded",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on this, we are able to support our hypothesis as we can conclude that there are a few, large outliers that skews our data, pulling our mean to a larger value",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, the interquartile range also provides us insight as the 25th percentile of 368,129 and the 75th percentile of 2,622,046 explains how only 25% of the channels exceeded the 75th percentile, averaging over 2.6M views per video count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This confirms how only a few amount of channels are successfully able to maintain a high engagement, or a large view per video count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The next factor to investigate is the category in which each channel is sorted and how that could affect the views per count the channel receives. Since YouTube contains a variety of content and people are making use of the platform for many different purposes, we can expect videos in different channel categories to bring different audience sizes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The target audience then may be correlated to video view count which we further look into through Table 1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Table 1, located above, displays the mean and standard deviation in viewsPerVideo of each channel category, and there are a few notable features",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Firstly, YouTube is most popular amongst the top three categories are “Music”, “Education”, and “Comedy” respectively",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The category to record the smallest view count per video, however, was “News & Politics”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A possible explanation would be how people may repeatedly watch, for example, music videos and educational videos for learning",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is not necessarily the case for news or politic videos,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, people are more likely to read the news or obtain news by other means outside of YouTube",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can further investigate the relationships of each channel category based on a box plot that allows for a side-by-side comparison, shown in Figure 2",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Figure 2, we are immediately able to take note of the outliers with an incredibly large viewsPerVideo count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For starters, there is a data point of 211M viewsPerVideo within the Music category",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is possible to assume that a certain channel is continuously uploading content of a popular artist that may be consistently releasing music videos with high view counts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When examining the median across channel categories, there is a range between 600K and 2M, only with the exception of “News & Politics” with median 18.6K",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In general, the channels specific to any category generally performs similarly based on the box sizes representing the distribution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Again, our three highest view count categories contain outliers with very large numbers that skewed our mean values to a higher number",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our final question at hand, is to study whether the number of subscribers of a channel and its respective viewsPerVideo count are correlated to one another",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Even though it seems intuitive that channels with a greater amount of subscribers would mean there is a larger following base, resulting in a higher viewsPerVideo count, that may not always be the case",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact, interactive content prompting engagement may cause for a lower viewsPerVideo count despite the large number of subscribers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also, the number of subscribers may not establish a direct relationship at all times due to YouTube algorithms increasing or decreasing exposure of videos that we are unaware of",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Similar to when we previously discussed the distribution and shape of viewsPerVideo, we take note of how this distribution is skewed to the right",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
There is a heavy concentration of data points when both values of viewsPerVideo and number of subscribers are on the lower end,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our hypothesis is supported by this data as a link exists, but there are other factors contributing to the varying viewsPerCount to a greater extent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The r^2 value of the correlation may help us further understand their relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Table 2 above displays the correlation between the two variables: viewsPerVideo and number of subscribers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A correlation of 0.135 does show a positive relationship but a very weak one,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems like the number of subscribers could increase the likelihood of viewsPerVideo amounting to a greater value,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, there must be other confounding variables that affects the viewsPerVideo numbers more than that of simply the subscriber count of the channel",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The research had made use of data collected from 1,259 different YouTube channels in order to determine whether or not their viewsPerVideo count were related to factors such as channel category and number of subscribers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Due to the fact that people are usually on YouTube for entertainment and educational purposes, it made sense that those respective categories resulted in a larger viewsPerVideo count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"On the other hand, since YouTube can be a subjective and opinionated platform, people are less likely to seek YouTube for the purpose of obtaining information regarding “News & Politics”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In terms of the correlation between subscriber count and viewsPerVideo, we also found a positive relationship but too small to consider as significant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The relationship concluded as a result of this data, however, was limiting in the sense that other factors that would largely affect viewsPerVideo were not accounted for",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, the “recommended video” feature and the YouTube algorithm in itself would greatly influence view count",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If further research were to be conducted, it would be necessary to delve into many other factors that would show a more direct link with viewsPerVideo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although factors such as the channel category and number of subscribers can have viewsPerVideo to vary, it is hard to come to the conclusion that these are the driving forces of viewsPerVideo for these various YouTube channels",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
