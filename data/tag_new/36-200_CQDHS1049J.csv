Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Social media has a prominent effect in today’s society,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"People connect with others through social media apps, such as Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and view everything online. In fact, we can also see many news and media companies turn to social media",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the past, when measuring success, companies were able to look at the number of sales in their articles and media",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, when measuring success in social media, it is often about the number of viewers and shares one gets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In fact, some companies actually pay their writers extra, as an incentive, based on the number of views and shares their article gets",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As a result, many writers and companies are extremely careful and self-aware about factors that could affect the number of shares one gets, some of these being the title of the length and the different channels available",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"One company, Mashable, a digital media website, has begun seeing what characteristics are related to their dissemination online. In order to understand the success of Mashable, we will be exploring the relationship between all the possible different channels offers, the title length of each article, and the number of shares distributed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The data used for this project was gathered by Mashable for their articles over two years times,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Articles are categorically grouped into one out of six channels: Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle, and date of publication",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Each article was then measured in terms of the number of shares received (count), and the number of words in the title",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The number of shares received and the number of words in the title is measured by count, where the count is greater than or equal to zero",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 1 shows the distribution of articles across all channels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can see that when grouping channels into three categories, most count, middle count, and least count, articles about World, Entertainment, and Tech fall into the most count category",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
those values range from 900 through 1100,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the middle category, we have Business and Other",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
760 articles fall into both of those categories each,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In our least count category, we have Social Media and Lifestyle, and that category contains 250 articles to 350 articles",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to understand what causes more shares and what causes fewer shares, we must first see whether or not there is a relationship between something that attracts a lot of readers: the title",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hypothesize that there is a relationship between the number of words in titles of different categories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To formalize this hypothesis, we will focus on the average title length of each article in all the possible channels",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To formalize this hypothesis, we will be focusing on the average title length and the different channels each article falls into",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let muB, muW, muO, muT, muE, muS, muL denote the true mean title lengths for Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle respectively",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternate hypotheses are as follows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To find the relationship, we can first start by visually examining our data through a box plot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 3 displays a boxplot showing the title length of different channels,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can see that the title lengths are pretty similar and that there is a little spike in titles revolving around Entertainment,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In addition to Figure 3, we will assess our hypothesis with a formal hypothesis test using a one-way ANOVA test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To use the ANOVA test, we need large sample sizes, and based on Figure 1, we know that all of our values are greater than 30, so we can apply a Normal approximation for inference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also need to ensure that our standard deviations are all similar between all our groups,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"our standard deviations are 2.158 words, 2.050 words, 2.014 words, 2.078 words, 2.149 words, 2.123 words, and 1.863 words, which are all within a factor of 2, so we are able to use ANOVA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since we meet our requirements for ANOVA, we can carry out a test at level 0.05",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After performing our ANOVA test, we see that our F Score is 25.4228 and our p-value is approximately 0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because our p-value is less than our 0.05 threshold, we can reject our null hypothesis of all the means being equal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the context of our current study, this means that there is sufficient evidence to show a relationship between title length in different channels, allowing us to conclude that there is sufficient evidence to show that different channels cause different title lengths",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the previous section, we showed that there is a relationship between the channel and the number of words in a title",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to get a clearer picture of everything, we must also look at whether or not there is a relationship between the date of publication and title length",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the distribution of the number of articles published by the date of publication shown in Figure 2, we hypothesize that articles released on Wednesday will have more words in the title",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To formalize this hypothesis, we will be focusing on the average title length and day released",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let muB, muW, muO, muT, muE, muS, muL denote the true mean title lengths for Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle respectively",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternate hypotheses are as follows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before testing the relationship between the two factors, we will first visualize our data through a boxplot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 4 displays a boxplot showing the relationship between title length depending on the day of publication,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While all of the days have different minimums and maximums, their median and quartiles are all about the same, suggesting that there may be no relationship between the two variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we pass all ANOVA requirements, we can begin carrying out a test at level 0.05",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our ANOVA test returns an F Score of 1.646 and a p-value of 0.1302,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because our p-value is greater than our 0.05 threshold, we fail to reject our null hypothesis, meaning that there is not sufficient evidence to conclude that there is a relationship between the day of publication and title length",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now that we know that there is more of a relationship between channel and title length than the day of publication and title length, we can begin looking at how different channels affect the number of shares received",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Different channels will definitely be shared different amount of times due to popularity that in that specific topic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because different articles often fall into different channels, as shown in Figure 1, we predict that the number of shares each article gets will depend on the channel that article falls into",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to formalize this hypothesis, we will focus on the average number of shares over all 6 channels",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Let muB, muW, muO, muT, muE, muS, muL represent the true mean number of shares for Business, World, Other, Tech, Entertainment, Social Media, and Lifestyle respectively",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternate hypotheses are as follows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before testing the relationship between the two factors, we will first visualize our data through a boxplot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 5 displays a boxplot showing the relationship between the number of shares when compared to each channel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We see that Other, Social Media, and Lifestyle get a lot of shares when compared to other channels, suggesting that there is most likely a relationship between channel and number of shares",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this project, we examine the different relationships about how different values can affect the overall number of shares different articles get",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We conclude that the number of shares each article gets is heavily dependent on the channel that article falls into and the number of words in the title,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, this project’s goal is to emphasize that there is a relationship between the two values, not look at why that occurs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Depending on what people are interested in today’s society, those channels may change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, people are heavily invested in Tech and Social Media today, but in the future, those interests may change",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further research is required into reasonings behind social media sharing to understand the differences observed between the shares throughout channels observed in this report,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
