Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"People have always wanted to attain immortality, and many researches have been conducted to find relationship between ages and different factors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As Preston Jorgensen asks, we are trying to explore the AnAge data to determine what factors appear to be related to lifespan, so that further researches could be conducted to use those factors to attain immortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) In this report, we try to explore the AnAge dataset and analyze the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also try to analyze whether a crab-eating raccoon with reduced metabolic rate will be a good companion (pet),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) The dataset we use is The AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is a “curated database of age- ing and life history in animals” that was “primarily developed for comparative biology studies”,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It contains general information about an animal, including lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, typical body temperature, and metabolic rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This dataset is compiled from hundreds of scientific papers, for over 4,200 species",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With our model, (3) we are concluding that metabolic rate does have an inverse significant impact on lifespan: the lower the unit metabolic rate, the higher the maximum lifespan in years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, at the same time, it is worth noticing that the model is not very accurate, and numbers can be far off when we look at any individual cases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We begin by performing some data transformation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While we want to explore the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan, we want to make sure that we are staying in the correct unit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) Since the body mass of an animal would contribute to its metabolic rate, we want to only compare different animals' metabolic rate per gram, which is why we first divided the variable `Metabolic.rate` by `Body.mass.g` to obtain a new column `Metabolic.by.mass`",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This new column describes the amount of energy used per unit of body mass, which allows us to compare between animals of different sizes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Now we want to explore the key variables we are using to address our research problem,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Since we will be exploring the relationship between unit metabolic rate and lifespan, we try to plot the histograms for `Metabolic.by.mass` and `Maximum.longevity.yrs`",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can see that both variables are heavily skewed to the left,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) In our problem, the response variable is `Maximum.longevity.yrs`, the maximum lifespan in units of years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We see that the data is heavily skewed to the left, leaning towards 0, and the distribution looks normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After exploring each individual variables, we want to take a look at the relationship between the two",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(4) We use a scatterplot to visualize the relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From figure 2 we can see that there is a dense cluster on the bottom left corner, which is expected since we had both variables heavily skewed to the left when we previously visualized the individual variables with histograms",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We want to transform both x and y variables by taking the log,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Figure 3 shows the new relationship of transformed unit metabolic rate and transformed maximum lifespan, which we could see a clearer relationship of the two variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now the general trend looks linear, but a linear model may not best describe the relationship between the two",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Further analysis in later sections will explore the linearity of the relation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) We also want to take a look at the other variables in order to better analyze the relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The two remaining variables are `Temperature` and `Body.mass.g`,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also try to transform the two variables, and from the scatterplots, we can see that there seems to be some semi linear relationship between log body mass and our response variable, while temperature seems to be unrelated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus we will also use `Log.body.mass.g` in our further analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6) Taking a look at figure 5 and we can identify some interesting trends,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We see that body mass and metabolic rate seems to have opposite correlation with our response variable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can also identify that there are fewer data points on the right end of transformed response variable, which could affect our analysis result and confidence interval when we continue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also can see some increase in variance corresponding to maximum lifespan in our plots, which might need to be adjusted in our next steps",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the relationship looks linear, (1) we want to first try to use a linear model, predicting `Maximum.longevity.yrs` using `Metabolic.by.mass` and `Log.body.mass.g`",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have Log.maximum.longevity.yrs = -0.28697  Log.metabolic.by.mass + 0.09638  Log.body.mass.g + 0.23651,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
From the p-value test we see that both variable are significant,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"By looking at the summary of the model we see that the $r^2$ value is 0.4311, which isn't very ideal, indicating there might be better models to describe the relationship",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the previous analysis and looking at the residual plot, we think that a large contribution to the low $r^2$ is the inconsistent variance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After trying a simple linear regression, we want to try using a smoothing spline. (2) We fit five models with effective degrees of freedom set to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now since we have two models, we want to assess which model is a better fit to the data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We are using cross-validation here, specifically k-fold cross-validation with $k = 5$",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) With performed k-fold cross-validation, we have the following squared errors: 0.3636333 for smoothing spline df 3, 0.3605180 for smoothing spline df 4, 0.3592511 for smoothing spline df 5, 0.3588349 for smoothing spline df 6, 0.3591142 for smoothing spline df 7, 0.3229807 for linear model of both metabolic rate and body mass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the linear model of both metabolic rate and body mass has is least squared error loss, this is the best model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(4) Now we want to analyze our selected best model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The qq plot looks normal, but some points are off the line on the sides (especially the right side)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the residuals plot, we can see that the residuals are nicely centered around 0 and spreaded evenly out without clear pattern",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, we can see that residuals are narrower on the two sides and wider in the middle, indicating some inconsistent variance, which looks like a major error source of our model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5) Looking at the MSE between the models, the MSE difference between the models does not seem very significant, especially between the smooth spline models of different df",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There are some difference, but still not very significant when we look at the MSE of the linear model (the difference is larger mainly because we are using an additional variable here)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For smoothing splines with a closer MSE to Linear model, we see that mean +- sd are largely overlapping, which makes the difference less significant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Though for some df, the MSE of smoothing spline differs more from the MSE of linear model, the uncertainty is also greater, making the difference less significant",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So what can we possible perform in the future to improve our results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6) As stated previously when we were examining the residual plots, we see that there are some inconsistent variance",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We could try resampling the residuals to see if this is a sampling issue,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the selected linear model, (1) since the coefficient for metabolic by mass is negative (-0.28697), we can conclude that animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, as requested by Preston Jorgensen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Now that we have a model proving our assumption, we want to estimate the mean lifespan of the crab-eating racoon if its metabolic rate is 50% smaller",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Using the linear model to predict and we have the new predicted maximum lifespan of 17.59354 years, if its metabolic rate is 50% smaller and other features remain",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) We then performed a bootstrap to make a 95% confidence interval with 1000 bootstrap iterations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The confidence interval is (6.005374, 33.61207) years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In conclusion, (1) after the analysis we found out that generally there is an inverse relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The lower the metabolic rate, the higher the lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Regarding whether reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change, yes it will change, and theoretically it will increase the maximum lifespan from estimation of 14.4206 to 17.59354",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, form the data we see that the maximum lifespan is actually 19",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Note from the confidence interval that the 95% confidence interval for this prediction is huge, ranging from 6.005374 to 33.61207 years, which means that it is very hard to guarantee prediction accuracy here",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have to notice that there are many limitations to this analysis that might affect the conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) First of all, we do not know if there are other factors contributing to this lifespan difference",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is very likely that some feature other than an animal's metabolic rate plays an important role here affecting the result,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also, notice that since we have a non-constant variance, it is also likely that the metabolic rate depends on some other variable, or some other variable correlated with the metabolic rate contributes to the difference in lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We are making this analysis based on the assumption that all variables we use are independent, which is likely not the real situation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
