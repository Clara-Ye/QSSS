Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) This report's main objective is to understand how certain air pollutants, namely ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter, and temperature contribute to mortality rates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To understand this objective, we seek to answer three main questions of interest to Preston Jorgensen, (1) Are these three air pollutants associated with increased mortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If so, which pollutant is the most strongly associated with mortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Is the effect of air pollution instantaneous or does it extend over time? and (3) If the level of pollution was lowered to match the lowest recorded values, what would the mean death rate be in Chicago on a 70-degree day",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Do we recommend that Preston Jorgensen finance such a decrease in pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) To answer these research questions, we will be using a dataset that contains measurements of air quality in Chicago, Illinois each day from January 1987 to the end of December 2000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The variables in this dataset include the date of the observation, the number of non-accidental deaths on that date, the mean temperature in Farehnheit, the median density of particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers, the median concentration of ozone, and the median concentration of sulfur dioxide. The dataset only includes lagged versions of the three pollutant variables and the temperature variable which give the 7-day averages of each variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) From our analyses, we found that (1) there is evidence that these pollutants are associated with increased mortality and ozone concentration is the most strongly associated with mortality, (2) we cannot determine if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extends over time, and (3) the estimated mean deaths for Chicago on a 70-degree day when the pollutant levels are the lowest values ever recorded is about 110 deaths so we don't recommend Jorgensen spend his fortune to try to reduce pollution to those levels because this predicted number of deaths is not much different from the average number of deaths on any given day",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In terms of data cleaning and preparation, we first decided to remove all observations with NA values",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We then converted the original ""time"" variable in the dataset to a ""date"" variable so that we know the date of the recorded observation rather than the number of days before or after December 31, 1993, which is less useful to our analyses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) We would like to explore each of the key variables to understand their distributions and potential outliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The histogram of the date variable indicates that we have a somewhat uniform distribution of observations from the start of 1987 to the end of 2000, however there are slightly less observations in the beginning of this timeframe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The temperature variable is distributed such that the majority of the data lies rather uniformly betwen 20 and 80 degrees Farehnehit but there are several low and high outliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The particulate matter variable is the median density of particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The particulate matter variable is heavily right-skewed with the majority of the data between -30 and 30 milligrams per cubic meter but there are several very large outliers,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The ozone variable is the median concentration of ozone pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ozone variable is rather uniform between -15 and 10 parts per billion, but has a slightly right-skewed distribution with there being some higher outliers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sulfur dioxide variable is the median contribution of sulfur dioxide. Its histogram indicates that the distribution is heavily right-skewed with the majority of the data lying between -5 and 5 grams per cubic meter,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The histograms of the lagged versions of the temperature and pollutant variables have very similar distributions to the non-lagged versions but do appear to have more of uniform distributions, indicating more stability",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) The response variable is the number of non-accidental deaths on a given date,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we'll be using a Poisson GAM with the log link for modeling purposes later, we will examine the distribution fo the log of the response variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The histogram of the log of the deaths variable indicates that the variable is fairly normally distributed, with the majority of the data lying between 4.5 and 5 log deaths but there are several higher outliers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) We will now explore some of the relationships between the predictors and log of the response variable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For each of the scatterplots with one of the predictors (three pollutant variables and temperature variable), there doesn't appear to be positive or negative relationship between the predictor and response because each scatterplot demonstrates somewhat of a blob of points with no clear shape",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In each plot, there are several outliers that indicate that certain dates just had many more deaths than usual",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The lagged versions of the scatterplots are very similar and don't contribute much more information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the scatterplot of log of deaths against date, we can see that there are several outliers with many more deaths than usual",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking up these dates, we see that in 1995 there was a very deadly heat wave in Chicago that is the reason for these outliers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, we choose to include these outliers rather than removing them from the analyses because they are explained by variables in the data and are meaningful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) An interesting trend in the data is that the lagged versions of the predictor variables appear to be more stable than the non-lagged versions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We note this because we might find later when we are modeling that the lagged versions of the predictors are more useful in predicting deaths because they are more stable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) We will fit two Poisson generalized additive models to the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the first model, we are using the non-lagged versions of the predictors and the second model we are using the lagged versions of the covariates instead of the non-lagged versions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
In both models we used spline smoother terms for all of the predictors with 4 degrees of freedom for all of the spline terms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We chose to use 4 degrees of freedom for simplicity and speed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We decided to use smoother terms for the predictors because of the predictors didn't appear to have a linear relationship with the response variable,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We decided to do one model with the non-lagged predictors and one model with the lagged predictors to determine if the lagged or non-lagged variables were better suited for modeling the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It didn't make sense to include both the lagged and non-lagged predictors in the same model because they contain similar information,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We didn't include date as a predictor because we are not interested in its effect on mortality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) We used 5-fold cross-validation to determine which of the two models better fits the data in terms of prediction error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We decided to use 5-fold cross-validation because we do not have a very large dataset so splitting the dataset into 5 folds is a reasonable amount so that each subset still has enough statistical power,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The mean prediction error for the first model is 201.5735 and the mean prediction error the second model is 188.0217,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We decided to use the second model for the rest of our analyses because the mean prediction error was slightly smaller,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) The difference between the models doesn't appear to be significant because the standard error of the estimate of the prediction error for the first model is 29.6185 and the standard error of the estimate of the prediction error for the second model is 27.622, meaning that the difference between the mean prediction errors is not greater than the uncertainty of either prediction",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, we decide to use the second model for the rest of the analyses because of the slightly smaller average prediction error",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) We conducted a global goodness-of-fit test on the model we chose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The p-value of the test is very close to 0, meaning that the chosen model with the covariates included is not sufficient to explain the data and we would prefer a saturated model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This makes sense as we would expect that many more covariates besides pollutants and deaths would be needed to adequately model non-accidental deaths including a host of other weather/environmental factors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) To determine whether the pollutants are associated with mortality, we fit a model that uses only temperature as a feature and not the pollutants and conduct an ANOVA chi-squared test to see if there is a statistically significant difference between the two models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We find that the model with temperature and the pollutants is better than the model without pollutants at a statistical significance level of alpha = 0.05 because the p-value of the chi-squared ANOVA test is less than 0.05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus we can conclude that there is evidence that that the three pollutants are statistically significantly associated with increased mortality,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) Based on our cross-validation results from the previous section, we cannot determine whether the effect of pollution appears to be instantaneous or extends over time because the difference in the average prediction errors of the two models (one with lagged variables and one with non-lagged variables) was not larger than the uncertainty of either of the prediction errors",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We decided to use the model with the lagged variables partly because of the slightly smaller average prediction error from cross-validation, but also due to the researcher's belief that the lagged pollutant and temperature variables contain more information and are more stable than the non-lagged variables and it would make sense that the effect of pollution would extend over time rather than be instantaneous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) For the model we chose, we plotted the average relationship between each predictor and the outcome with uncertainty bars and can determine from the plots that ozone concentration is the pollutant most associated with mortality because its relationship with deaths looks the least flat and uniform",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) We calculated the smallest value observed for each pollution variable and used these to create an estimate using our chosen model for the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with those levels of pollutants,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We predict that the mean number of deaths on a 70-degree day with those minimum levels of pollutants would be 110.435 deaths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 95% confidence interval for this prediction is from 106.39 deaths to 114.633 deaths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the residuals diagnostics plots of our chosen model, we have some hesitancy with assuming that all of the assumptions are met",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the plots, we cannot firmly conclude that the residuals are distributed with constant variance and that the residuals are normally distributed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because of these somewhat skeptical assumptions we choose to bootstrap our previous confidence interval using the resampling residuals method because it doesn't rely on assumptions of the distribution of the residuals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We chose to use the pivotal confidence interval because asymptomatically it will have about 95% coverage, which is what we want",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will use 1000 bootstrap iterations because this is standard practice for many bootstrapping procedures,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6) The bootstrapped 95% confidence interval is 105.668 deaths to 115.582 deaths,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7) We notice a difference between the two confidence intervals,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The bootstrapped confidence interval is slightly wider than the non-bootstrapped confidence interval,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This indicates that we the model meets its assumptions maybe better than we originally thought after looking at the diagnostics because being safer by doing the resampling residuals method of bootstrapping resulted in a wider confidence interval,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This difference is a good thing because it leads us to believe that our model meets its assumptions better than we originally though,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) From our analyses we found that there was a significant positive association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality in Chicago during this time frame,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The pollutant that was most strongly associated with increased deaths was ozone concentration,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our analyses could not conclude whether the effect of pollution was instantaneous or extends over time. The predicted mean deaths on a 70-degree day when the pollutants are the minimum values recorded is about 110 deaths, which is not very different from the average number of deaths in this dataset, at around 115",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Preston Jorgensen should not spend his enormous fortune to reduce the pollutants to their minimum recorded values because our analyses do not demonstrate a causal relationship whereby reducing pollutants causes a decrease in mortality by the amount our model estimated,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"There may be many other variables at large that affect mortality and pollutant levels, so we do not know that reducing pollutants would decrease mortality even though there is an associative relationship since this is observational data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) One of the major limitations to our analyses is that the model we chose had a very low p-value, meaning that its covariates do not sufficiently model the response variable and that a saturated model is preffered",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This majorly affects our conclusions because the conclusions are contingent on the model being correct and sufficiently modeling the response and that is not the case,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another limitation is that the data didn't include more variables that might affect both pollution and mortality, such as other weather variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, this dataset is very outdated and climate change has likely increased the level of pollution and average temperature values drastically just in the last 10 years so these analyses don't tell Preston Jorgensen much about how the relationship between current day pollutants and mortality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
