Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
One of the major hot-button issues nowadays is the idea of pollution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many believe the world around us is dying, as major events such as mass extinction and climate changed are fueled by an increasingly toxic world",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Acid rain, smog, and fires that seem to burn forever continue to ravage the Earth and its environment",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Many species are dying out because of these toxic conditions, and thus many scientists theorize that there may also be a relationship between this increase in toxicity and a possible increase in mortality in humans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"That is to say, in this study we are interested in discovering if there is evidence to support this theorized positive relationship between pollution and mortality, and, if so, is this effect instantaneous or extending over time? (1) We would also like to use temperature to help model this relationship, as temperature is known to increase mortality (death rate), and we would like to use our model to predict what the death rate would be at a given temperature if we were able to reduce the pollution so that we may determine how much we need to reduce the pollution to improve a death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Of the several contributing factors to pollution, we will be examining air pollution, as all humans regardless of location need clean air to breathe",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this study, we will be analyzing the relationship of pollution and temperature on death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will be using a set of data from each day in Chicago, Illinois between January 1, 1987 to December 31, 2000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The set of data includes a measurement of time (the date of observation), the death rate (number of people that died non-accidentally in a given day), and the mean temperature (Fahrenheit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It also contains measurements of air quality, or, more specifically, measurements of the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution which the median density of particulate matter with a diameter of less than 10 micrometers (measured in milligrams per cubic meter), the median concentration of ozone (in parts per billion, ppb), the median concentration of sulfur dioxide (in parts per billion, ppb), and finally 7-day averages of the temperature and all three air pollutants",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) We are interested in particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide in particular because ozone gas is toxic when inhaled, sulfur dioxide is a key contributor to acid rain and is toxic to humans, and particulate matter (like soot) when inhaled can become stuck in the lungs and cause severe damage",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We concluded that there exists a true, positive relationship between death rate and the 7-day averages of the pollutants and temperature to predict death rate, which indicates that the effect of pollution on death rate is likely extended over several days, meaning that as these averages increased, there is evidence that death rate increased as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To answer our research question, we will be exploring temperature, median ozone concentration, median sulfur dioxide concentration, median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution, and the death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We will also be examining the 7-day averages of the temperature, median ozone concentration, median sulfur dioxide concentration, and median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution variables, as they may be helpful in allowing us to assess whether any underlying relationship between pollution and death rate is instantaneous or extends over time. Initially, we observed univariate distributions of these key variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In figures 1 and 6, we can see that the distribution of daily temperature and temperature averaged over 7 days are both bimodal with modes at roughly 30 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, and both are also skewed slightly left",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) In figures 2, 3, and 4, we can see that the median concentrations of ozone and sulfur dioxide, and the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution all appear to be skewed slightly to the right",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) In figures 7, 8, and 9 we see that averaging the median concentrations of ozone and sulfur dioxide as well as the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution do not change their distribution, as is expected",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) In figure 5, we assess the univariate distribution of our response variable, the logarithmically transformed death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) We assess the logarithmic transformation of the death rate as we intend to perform Poisson nonparametric generalized additive modeling (GAM) with the log link to model the relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The logarithm of the death rate shows a normally-distributed, unimodal distribution",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) After univartiate analysis of the key variables, we then assessed the data for any underlying relationships between our predictor variables and the response variable of logarithmic death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As the averages of the temperature and pollution variables have the same distributions as the medians, we will not be plotting the relationship of the averages with death rate as the underlying distribution of the relationship between death rate and the averages and death rate and the medians should be the same",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) We can see in figure 10 that the logarithmic number of deaths across the years has a relatively cyclic distribution, with perhaps lower death rates in certain seasons than others",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) We also see four outliers with around 225 - 400 deaths (much greater than the apparent average of about 150 deaths),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These outliers occur on July 13-16 in 1995, which in Chicago's history correspond to a record-breaking heat wave that causes many deaths",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"While the heat wave can be explained by temperature, there is other data suggesting these are an anomaly (other death rates on days with the same temperature were much lower)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"therefore, we will remove these four outliers from the data so as to not bias our regression",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) Figure 11 shows a slightly negative correlation between logarithmic death rate and temperature,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) Figures 12 shows possibly a slightly negative correlation between ozone concentration and logarithmic death rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Finally, Figure 13 shows a slightly positive correlation between sulfur dioxide concentration and logarithmic death rate, and figure 14 shows a slightly negative correlation between $PM_{10}$ pollution and logarithmic death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) We did try a few transformations of the data such as logarithmically modifying the predictors, but none of the transformations improved the correlation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In general, any linear correlation is weak, suggesting that the underlying relationship between death rate and pollution and temperature is not linear, which means we should choose nonparametric regression models such as a Poisson generalized additive model to assess our data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to determine the most accurate regression model for the data, we begin by constructing two Poisson generalized additive models to the data with spline smoothing terms having 4 degrees of freedom for all predictor models, and the first model uses the regular median pollution predictors and temperature, the second model uses the average median predictors for pollution and temperature (1) We discovered using 5-fold cross validation error for model 1 (using the regular predictors) was 84217.7375, and the error for model 2 (using the average predictors) was 151.9305",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) We therefore can say that model 2 is the better model based on the cross validation error,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As there is a very large difference between the two errors, it is likely that this difference is significant and any uncertainty is negligible, and as such we will be using model 2 for the rest of the analysis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We first conduct a global chi-squared goodness-of-fit test of our model 2, which uses the average of the temperature and pollution variables as predictors of death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The value produced by the test is 0, which indicates that for these data, there is significant evidence to reject the original model in favor of a ""saturated model"" with n degrees of freedom (meaning our model fit could be better)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) We then wish to determine whether the pollutants, or only temperature are having an effect on our regression model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To test this, we will construct a model using only temperature as a predictor",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We will assume initially (our null hypothesis) that there is no difference between our model using only temperature and our model using temperature and the pollutants.The alternative hypothesis is that there is a significant improvement in the model upon adding the average of the pollutants as predictors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We use a Chi-Squared test to assess this, and as there is a p-value of 1.19 x $10^{-15}$ produced, we can say there is significant evidence that our model using the averages of the pollutants and temperature as predictors improves significantly on the model using only temperature to predict death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Therefore, we can say there is significant evidence that adding the averages of the pollutants improves the regression",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) As we established the model using the 7-day averages of each pollutants and temperature to be a better fit as it has lower cross-validation error, we can say that it is likely the effect of pollution appears to extend over time. (3) Figure 15 demonstrates analytic plots for our chosen model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can see that the 7-day average of temperature does seem to be the most associated with death rate, but of the 3 pollutants, the 7-day average of the median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution appears to be the next highest associated variable with death rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Using the smallest values of pollutants for each 7-day average (-18.92390 ppb for the average median ozone concentration, -4.643285 ppb for the average median sulfur dioxide concentration, and -12.42099207 milligrams per cubic meter for the average median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution) and 70 degrees Fahrenheit for the temperature, we predict the death rate to be approximately 109 people dying that day under those conditions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5) We constructed a 95% confidence interval on this prediction which was [105.4345, 112.3879], that is to say there is significant evidence to support our prediction that under these specific conditions, the death rate falls within the interval [105.4345, 112.3879] given the assumptions and limitations of the model, which we assume only fails less than 5% of the time, and as our value falls within the interval, we can say it is likely to be accurate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(5) Upon bootstrapping the data, we get a new confidence interval of roughly [107, 110] (6)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is different than our previous interval, possibly because we re-sampled the cases (indicating nonparametric bootstrapping and that we could not conclude our error was uniformly distributed) are are testing many more samples, whereas before we had simply assumed our set model was the correct one",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(7),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In summary, there appears to be an underlying Poisson relationship in whcih increased death rate and corresponds to increased 7-day average of median ozone concentration, median sulfur dioxide concentration, median density of $PM_{10}$ pollution, and temperature, which we can model using a Poisson generalized additive model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) Essentially, as these predictors increase, the death rate increases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, we can conclude that reducing the pollutants would cause mortality to decrease to the amount the model estimated, as our value for the prediction falls within a 95% confidence interval established by our model, indicating that we can reject the null hypothesis that decreasing the pollutants would have no effect at a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Finally, our analysis may be limited by the transformations of the data, as we can see in figures 11 - 14 that perhaps data transformations may have been helpful, but none of those tried seemed to be effective. Additionally, the resampling cases bootstrap may have been too broad and as such less accurate, so it may be helpful to check more in-depth whether the error of our model is uniformly distributed, so that we may do a resampling residuals and more specific bootstrap",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) such, it is important to consider that",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
