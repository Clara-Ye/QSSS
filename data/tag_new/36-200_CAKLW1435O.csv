A Study of the Relationship Between the Position of a Soccer Player and their Statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soccer, otherwise known as football, is a well-known sport that is played all around the world with playability ranging from kicking a ball around to being the main focus of international competitions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Soccer has been focused around many people’s lives whether it be playing the sport or being a super-fan of it, which makes it not only important as a sport but also important as a way of life. In professional leagues, variable statistics are recorded on players to determine how skilled they are and how well they do within a certain league",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Professional players aim to raise their football statistics in order to attract the attention of grander teams and therefore get signed and earn more money,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This study looks at which factors may play a role into raising a soccer player’s statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Specifically, the goal of this report is to use Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to investigate if the position of a soccer player affects their statistics in terms of playtime, shots attempted, and total passes made",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The information in this study may be of use to aspiring soccer players as well as professional players that may not be earning as much as they would like to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Information has been collected on a sample of 595 soccer players,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sample used for this study contains all players that appeared within the 2010 FIFA World Cup,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our main focus will be on the variable Position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Position is a categorical variable that shows the main position for a certain player,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The most common position within the sample is Midfielder while the least common position is Goalkeeper,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our research questions will also focus on the three variables of playtime, shots attempted, and total passes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The variable playtime is a quantitative variable that shows the time on the field a certain player got (in minutes),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The variable shots attempted is also a quantitative variable that shows the number of attempts a player shot the ball to the opposing goal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The variable total passes is once again a quantitative variable that shows the total number of passes a player made,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Research Scenarios,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between a Soccer Player’s Position and their Playtime,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our first question will be to analyze if there is any association or correlation between a soccer player’s position and the amount of playtime they receive within a professional season,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To measure this, we will need to conduct an inferential test and we will choose an alpha value of 1%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We hypothesize that there is a relationship between a player’s position and their playtime. To formulate this hypothesis, we will need to focus on the mean playtime for each position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The positions of interest are Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Respectively, Let mptG, mptD, mptM, and mptF represent the true mean playing time for each position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternate Hypothesis (HA): At Least one Mean not Equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before conducting a formal test for the hypotheses, we visually compare the distribution of playtime for the four player positions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 1 below displays a boxplot of playtime for each position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can see that both Defender and Goalkeeper positions tend to get more playing time than Midfielder and Forward positions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both Defender and Goalkeeper positions have a median of 270 minutes while the Midfielder position has a median of 167 minutes and the Forward position has the lowest median of 132 minutes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also see that the minimum for midfielders and defenders is 1 minute, the minimum for forwards is 2, and the minimum for goalkeepers is 45",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The maximum for midfielders and goalkeepers is 570 minutes, the maximum for forwards is 564, and the maximum for defenders is 540",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another thing we observe is that the interquartile ranges for the Midfielder and Forward positions are both between 50 and 300 while the interquartile range for the Defender position is between 100 and 400,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The interquartile range for the Goalkeeper position is between 250 and 400, which is well above the ranges for the other positions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The last thing we observe is that there are no outliers when looking at all the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, this suggests that there is a relationship between playtime and a player’s position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All standard deviations are within a factor of 2, meaning they are so sufficiently close to use ANOVA",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since our assumptions are met, we can perform the test at level 0.01",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After performing the ANOVA test, we get a test statistic of F = 15.7301 and a p-value that is approximately 0 (p-value = 0)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the p-value of 0 is below the alpha value of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This means that the mean playtime for each position is not equal, and we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between position and playtime. With this conclusion, we also see that the best position for a player in order to have the most playtime is Goalkeeper, followed by Defender, then Midfielder, and then Forward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between a Soccer Player’s Position and their Shots Attempted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our second question will be to analyze if there is any association or correlation between a soccer player’s position and the shots that they attempt within a professional season,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To measure this, we will need to conduct an inferential test and we will choose an alpha value of 1%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hypothesize that there is a relationship between a player’s position and their shots attempted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To formulate this hypothesis, we will need to focus on the mean shots attempted for each position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The positions of interest are again Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Respectively, Let msaG, msaD, msaM, and msaF represent the true mean shots attempted for each position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternate Hypothesis (HA): At Least one Mean not Equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before conducting a formal test for the hypotheses, we visually compare the distribution of shots attempted for the four player positions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 2 below displays a boxplot of shots attempted for each position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can see that the Forward position tends to attempt more shots than the other positions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Defender position has a median of 1 shot attempted while the Midfielder position has a median of 2 shots attempted and the Forward position has the greatests median of 3 shots attempted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
An interesting thing to point out is that the Goalkeeper position has no median,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also see that the minimum shots attempted for all positions is 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The maximum for midfielders is 15, the maximum for forwards is 27, the maximum for defenders is 11, and the maximum for goalkeepers is 1",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another thing we observe is that the interquartile ranges for all positions is between 0 and 10 shots attempted,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The last thing we observe is that there are some outliers above the upper fence in all positions, but the Forward position has the most and the highest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, this suggests that there is a relationship between playtime and a player’s position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All standard deviations are within a factor of 2, meaning they are so sufficiently close to use our ANOVA test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since our assumptions are met, we can perform the test at level 0.01",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After performing the ANOVA test, we get a test statistic of F = 33.3328 and a p-value that is approximately 0 (p-value = 0)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the p-value of 0 is below the alpha value of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This means that the mean shots attempted for each position is not equal, and we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between position and shots attempted",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With this conclusion, we also see that the best position for a player in order to have the most shots attempted is Forward, followed by Midfielder, then Defender, and then Goalkeeper",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Relationship Between a Soccer Player’s Position and their Total Passes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our third question will be to analyze if there is any association or correlation between a soccer player’s position and the total passes they make within a professional season,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To measure this, we will need to conduct an inferential test and we will choose an alpha value of 1%",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hypothesize that there is a relationship between a player’s position and their total passes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To formulate this hypothesis, we will need to focus on the mean total passes for each position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The positions of interest are once again Goalkeeper, Defender, Midfielder, and Forward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Respectively, Let mtpG, mtpD, mtpM, and mtpF represent the true mean total passes for each position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Alternate Hypothesis (HA): At Least one Mean not Equal,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before conducting a formal test for the hypotheses, we visually compare the distribution of total passes for the four player positions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Figure 3 below displays a boxplot of total passes for each position,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can see that the Midfielder and Defender positions tend to make more passes than the other two positions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Defender position has the greatest median of 89 total passes while the Midfielder position has a median of 72.5 total passes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Forward position has a median of 35 total passes and the Goalkeeper position has a median of 52 total passes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also see that the minimum total passes for all positions is 0 except for Goalkeeper which has a minimum of 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The maximum for midfielders is 563, the maximum for forwards is 321, the maximum for defenders is 402, and the maximum for goalkeepers is 149",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Another thing we observe is that the interquartile ranges for all positions is between 0 and 200 total passes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The last thing we observe is that there are some outliers above the upper fence in all positions, but the Midfielder position has the highest",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, this suggests that there is a relationship between playtime and a player’s position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"All standard deviations are within a factor of 2, meaning they are so sufficiently close to use our ANOVA test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since our assumptions are met, we can perform the test at level 0.01",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After performing the ANOVA test, we get a test statistic of F = 16.8992 and a p-value that is approximately 0 (p-value = 0)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the p-value of 0 is below the alpha value of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This means that the mean total passes for each position is not equal, and we can conclude that there is sufficient evidence for a relationship between position and total passes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With this conclusion, we also see that the best position for a player in order to have the most total passes is Defender, followed by Midfielder, then Goalkeeper, and then Forward",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion/Conclusion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this study, we examined the relationship between a soccer player’s position and their statistics in terms of their playtime, shots attempted, and total passes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We found that a player’s position is associated with all three variable statistics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We first saw that the best position for playtime is by far Goalkeeper, the best position for shots attempted is Forward followed closely by Midfielder, and the best position for total passes is Defender followed closely by Midfielder",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The results of this study further imply that a player’s certain position is associated with certain variable statistics that are more prominent within these positions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It is also important to note that a player’s position does not correlate to these variable statistics, but is only associated with them",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"A limitation of this study is that the sample may have been biased since it took data from the 2010 World Cup, which includes world-class players but not average professional league players",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Another limitation may be that other variable statistics not in the data were not tested, such as goals made",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order for other studies to build on this work, it is important to look at other variable statistics such as goals made to determine if any of them are related to a soccer player’s position",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, it may be interesting for other studies that may base this work to look at the relationship between certain variable statistics and other sports",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
