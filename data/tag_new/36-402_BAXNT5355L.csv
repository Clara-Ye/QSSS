Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The idea of immortality is something that has long been captivating idea for humans,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The ability to live forever means no longer having to fear death, you can see loved ones forever and see how the world changes from decade to decade and millenium to millenium",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) While we are far away from ultimately answering immortality we can answer three following questions about factors relating to lifespan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first being whether slowing the metabolic rate —for example, by intermittent fasting— leads to longer lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also want to find out if the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate is linear or nonlinear,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, using our model on metabolic rate and lifespan we want to be able to estimate what the mean lifespan of animal with characteristics of crab-eating racoon with a 50% smaller metabolic rate than normal",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) We plan to use the Age Database of Animal Aging and Longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This dataset contains variables such as metabolic rate, lifespan/longevity , body mass and more for over 300 animals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The dataset we will be using is the Age Database of Animal Aging and Longevity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Age Database of Animal Aging and Longevity is a curated database of ageing and life history in animals, including extensive longevity records",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) There are several variables in the dataset including longevity, meatabolic rate, body mass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From this dataset we define two key variables, lifespan and `metabolic.by.mass`",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"`metabolic.by.mass`, which we will refer to as metabolic rate, is the metabolic rate divided by body mass, which gives us the amount of energy used per unit of body mass",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2)We will start by looking at each variable individually,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Figure 1, we see the histograms for both lifespan and metabolic rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Both varibles appear to be heavily right skewed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This raises the idea that perhaps transformations should be used,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Boxplots were made for metabolic rate and lifespan (figure not shown), which both indicated outliers",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We also looked at normality plots for metabolic rate and lifespan (figure not shown), which both showed clear devation from normality",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Thus this solidifies the idea that we should use transformations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) and some of (4) Due to the right skewness of both histogram distributions pre-transformation, we perform a square root transformation on metabolic rate, the explanatory variable, and a log transformation on lifespan, the response variable to rectify the skews",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In Figure 2, we see the updated histogram for log(lifespan) shows a fairly normal distribution and the updated histroram for log(metabolic rate) shows a fairly normal distribution and a small left-skew",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The normality plots and the boxplots (not shown) show us fewer outliers and better alignment, so the transformations were successful",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From here on we use the the transformed variables, log(metabolic rate) and log(lifespan)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(4) Next, we explored how the variables were related to each other in order to get a better idea of how to fit models to the data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Below in Figure 3, we see a scatterplot of the two variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) Figure 3 has the scatter plot that shows us the relationship between log metabolic rate and log lifepsan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We also calculate the correlation between the variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6) From Figure 3, we can see for the most part linear, negative relationship",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As metabolic rate increases, lifespan decreases",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This coincides with the rate of living theory which states postulates that the faster an organism's metabolism, the shorter its lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"At lower levels of metabolic rate, the trend is not as clear, for the most part lifespan is higher yet but the range of lifespans is higher than at higher levels of metabolic rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the exploratory data analysis done, we now fit models to the data to investigate patterns between lifespan and metabolic rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) We start by examining a simple linear model: $$Lifespan = beta_0 + beta_1(Metabolic Rate)$$,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Then we create five more sophisticated, spline models with effective degrees of freedom values ranging from 3 to 7, inclusive. (3) In order to determine which of these models fits the data best, we do a standard 5-fold cross-validation test on each spline model and the linear model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The errors for each of the spline models can be seen in Figure 4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can see that the a df parameter equal to 5 has the minimum mean squared error of 0.3577763 and a standard error of 0.027661,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The linear model has a mean squared error of 0.3669902 and a standard error of 0.0047721,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the best spline model has a slighly lower mean squared error and a slightly higher standard error than the linear model,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However the differences in the mean squared errors and the standard errors are quite small, suggesting that we can not definitively tell which model is better",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the models have relatively similar perfmance, following Occam's Razor we choose the simpler, linear model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Diagnostics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(4) Figure 5 shows the residuals vs fitted and normality plots for the linear model we chose,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on the normality plot it seems like our normality assumption is fine. However, in the residual plot it seems that the constant variance assumption may be violated",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking at Figure 6, it appears that a line fits the scatter plot generally well, but we might have some concern when using this model to predict an animal's lifespan using its metabolic rate because lifespan seems to largely vary at certain metabolic rates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(5) The differences between the largest mean squared error of models and the smallest mean squared error for the spline models are smaller than the differences between the standard errors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
So the models don't seem to differ significantly in performance,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(6) Based on our diagnostics plots, we have no problem with the normality assumption for our model, however we have a problem with our constant variance assumption",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Because our constant variance assumption is an issue we can't use our normal parmetric bootstrap method,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Instead we can use our resampling of residuals bootstrap method, as that would be more appropriate in this situation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) According to our model, animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For every one unit increase in log metabolic rate, there is 0.51269 decrease in log lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This translates to for every one unit increase in metabolic rate, there is a decrease in lifespan of 1.669777 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Applyin the model to the crab-eating raccoon, we estimate that with a 50% decrease in metabolic rate its lifespan would be 28.42159 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The crab-eating raccoon's mean lifespan is 19 years at its normal metabolic rate,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"This is what expected, mean lifespan goes up when metabolic rate decrease",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) The pivotal 95% resampling of residuals bootstrap method confidence interval with 1000 iterations gives us an interval of (19.24863,41.35943)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) We did find a relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
After transforming the data we observed a negative linear relationship,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With one unit of increase in metabolic rate, there is decrease in lifespan of 1.669777 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Preston Joregensen can conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% increases its lifespan years from 19 to 28.42159,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The confidence interval of (19.24863,41.35943) years doesn't include the normal lifespan which is sufficent evidence to suggest an increase in lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
