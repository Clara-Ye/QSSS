Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Preston Jorgensen, a billionaire who is interested in knowing what factors appear to be related to lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Given in-depth information and data of ageing and life history in animals from hundreds of scientific papers for over 4,200 species, we will answer the following three questions",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First, some research has suggested that slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan-- is this supported by the evidence",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second, is the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan nonlinear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, what does our model estimate for the mean lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon's characteristics but a 50 % smaller metabolic rate",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our analysis led us to the conclusion that the decrease in metabolic rate leads to increase in lifespan,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As `Maximum.longevity.yrs` decreases by 0.3999% when `Metabolic.by.mass` increases by 1 %,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We got a 95 % confidence interval as (-0.4558601, -0.3440440)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The AnAge data we will be exploring contains 347 observations of 14 variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We define some key variables for our research,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First variable is `Maximum.longevity.yrs`, which is our response variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It represents the maximum lifespan in years,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
`Metabolic.rate` and `Body.mass.g` are our explonatory variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
`Metabolic.rate` represents the typical resting metabolic rate and its unit is in Watts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
`Body.mass.g` represents the typical adult body mass and its unit is in Watts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, we will be creating a new variable called `Metabolic.by.mass`, which is the the amount of energy used per unit of body mass, instead of using `Metabolic.rate` since `Metabolic.by.mass` allows to compare the animals of different sizes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) Looking at the distribution graphs of `Metabolic.by.mass` and `Body.mass.g` below in figure 1, it is clear that both are right-skewed, which means the mean is greater than the median (as shown in figure 2)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, for `Temperature` variable, it is clear that it is left-skewed, and its median is greater than the mean",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(2) Our response variable is `Maximum.longevity.yrs`, which represents maximum lifespan in years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking at the distribution graph below in figure 3, it is clear that it is right-skewed meaning the mean is greater than the median (shown in figure 4)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(3) Additionally, I have used a pairs plot to show the correlation between the continuous variables in the dataset, and check if there exists any multicollinearity in between variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Checking the pairs plot below in figure 5, we can see that there is no variable with significantly high correlation that may lead to multicollinearity issue",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Based on observations, there should be transformations on the variables since there were right-skewed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We have decided to use log transformation on these variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new distribution graphs after the log transformation shown in figure 6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After the transformation, the distribution is not skewed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Moreover, we built some linear models with different types of transformation",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking at the below graphs in firgure 7 and summary, the model with both variables log transformed has the highest multiple R-squeared and the relationships appear to be linear",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The model without transformation has multiple R-squeared of 0.2929, the model with `Metabolic.by.mass` log transformed has multiple R-squeared of 0.342, the model with both variables log transformed has multiple R-squeared of 0.6036, and the model with `Metabolic.by.mass` variable square-rooted has multiple R-squeared of 0.2345",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We expect to see negative relationship between `Metabolic.by.mass` and `Maximum.longevity.yrs` variables in the analysis since we see a negative trend between explanatory variables in the pairs plot in figure 5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(6),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We constructed linear model and spline models to answer the research questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If we first take a look at the linear model (shown in below figure 8), we can see it has a linear trend",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(1) With effective degrees of freedom from 3 to 7, we can now fit some smoothing spline models",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) Now we can perfrom cross-validation to determine which model would fit the best in our dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We use 5-fold cross validation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Looking at the graphs above in figure 9 and our cross-validation prediction error table, we choose 6 as our degress of freedom for our spline model",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3) We now explore diagnostic plot for both linear and spline models,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It seems like there's no sign of violation of assumptions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Results,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We use the third model from the EDA transformation part, which had both variables log transformed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From the summary, we can see that log(Metabolic.by.mass) is -0.39993, which tells that `Maximum.longevity.yrs` decreases by 0.3999% when `Metabolic.by.mass` increases by 1 %",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) The crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate has a metabolic rate of 0.002231,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The new rate given that is 50% smaller is 0.00111,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When we plug these values into the linear model and the spline model, we get 17.60354 and 20.77764",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The observation given by the spline model makes more sense because we expect the new lifespan to be longer than the original lifespan of crab-eating raccoon,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) We can use bootstrapping to the linear model to make a 95% confidence interval for that quantity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We use the pivotal confidence interval and 1000 bootstrap iterations,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The 95 % confidence interval of log(Metabolic.by.mass) is between -0.4558601 and -0.3440440,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(3),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To summerize our models, the decrease in metabolic rate leads to increase in lifespan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
As `Maximum.longevity.yrs` decreases by 0.3999% when `Metabolic.by.mass` increases by 1 %,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We got a 95 % confidence interval as (-0.4558601, -0.3440440)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(1) Preston Jorgensen can conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change in increase by 1.77764,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
(2) We couldn't find violations of assumptions or limitations in the data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
