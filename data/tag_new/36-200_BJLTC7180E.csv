Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Different substances are all around us, and can have a very large impact on individuals’ lives. It seems fairly common in our world to drink alcohol, smoke, or use drugs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Especially being an undergrad in college, it’s interesting to see just how prevalent these substances are within the “college bubble",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, substances can undoubtedly have a huge impact on people’s lives; when I consider such an impact, it is usually negative as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For this research, we are interested in the possible associations which may exist between one’s sex and substance-usage habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Through our three scenarios and hypotheses tests, we explore the relationship between sex and drinking, smoking, and drug habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Data,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The data for this project was gathered via a volunteered sample from San Francisco OKCupid Users,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The sample size consists of 1,500 individuals who were active on 06/30/2012 and had active accounts on 06/26/2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The data consists of 17 different variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
our research will focus on 4 of these variables,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The relevant variables include sex (m/f), drinks (very often, often, socially, rarely, desperately, not at all), smokes (yes, sometimes, when drinking, trying to quit, no), and drugs (never, sometimes, often)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to visualize the relevant distributions of these 4 variables, the following figures (figure 1, figure 2, figure 3, and figure 4) are bar graphs of our variables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"From these separate data distributions, the following research scenarios/hypotheses will aim to explore the possible relationships which may exist between sex and drinking, smoking, and drugs habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, it is important to note a few issues within the data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The first aspect to note is that sex is defined as either male or female, thus working from a biological perspective distinguished from sex",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, the data was obtained via a volunteered sample, therefore, our findings could be biased",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this report, we are interested in exploring whether an association exists between sex and drinking habits, using drugs, or smoking habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The first possible relationship we will discuss is between sex and drinking habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hypothesize that there will be a relationship between sex and drinking habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H0: There is no association between sex and drinking habits (sex and drinking habits are independent),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ha: There is an association between sex and drinking habits (sex and drinking habits are dependent),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before formally testing the hypothesis, we will compare the differences in proportions between these three categorizations within the drinking variable among males and females",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The following figure displays a contingency table for proportion for each group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can observe from this table that males have higher proportions within every single drinking category,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These differences in proportion informally suggest a relationship between sex and drinking habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, we assess our hypotheses with a formal inference for contingency tables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we are exploring the relationship between a categorical explanatory and a categorical response variable, the Chi-Square Test is the appropriate test to use",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to use the Chi-Square Test, a number of formal assumptions must be met",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First, we must be using contingency table data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we are looking at a categorical explanatory (male/female) and categorical response variable (not at all, often, socially), we use a contingency table",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Second, the categories must be independent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because each individual is only in one cell of the table, we know that our categories are independent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Additionally, 3 more conditions must be met to justify the Chi-Square Test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"First, the data must be gathered randomly",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although this data set came from a volunteered sample, we will assume that it is reasonably random for the sake of our research",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Secondly, we must have statistically independent measures within each cell",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because our population is large, we can safely assume our measures are independent",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Lastly, we must have sufficient size for each expected cell-count (at least 5)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Calculating the expected cell counts, we find that not every single cell has at least 5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, the study could easily combine categories in order to account for this",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since our assumptions are met (for the most part), we carry out our test at alpha=0.05",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our Chi-Square Test produces a test statistic of Chi-Sq=2.9442, and a p-value of 0.8158",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and drinking habits, and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for a relationship between sex and drinking habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although we have not confirmed there to be a relationship between sex and drinking habits, we are interested in exploring a different possible relationship: sex and smoking habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hypothesize that there will be an association between sex and smoking habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H0: There is no association between sex and smoking habits (sex and smoking habits are independent),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ha: There is an association between sex and smoking habits (sex and smoking habits are dependent),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before formally testing the hypothesis, we will compare the differences in proportions between the categorizations within the smoking variable among males and females",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The following figure displays a contingency table for proportion for each group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As did the first contingency table, we can observe that males have higher proportions within every single smoking category",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These differences in proportion informally suggest a relationship between sex and smoking habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As in our first research scenario, we assess our hypotheses with a formal inference for contingency tables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Again, we are looking at the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a categorical response variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, we will use the Chi-Square Test again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the formal conditions that must be met in order to use the Chi-Square Test have been discussed and justified in the first research question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since our assumptions are met in the same manner as above, we carry out our test at alpha=0.05",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our Chi-Square Test produces a test statistic of Chi-Sq=7.3913, and a p-value of 0.1931",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and smoking habits, and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for a relationship between sex and smoking habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Again, we have not confirmed there to be a relationship between sex and another response variable (smoking habits)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, we remain interested in exploring a different possible relationship: sex and drug habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We hypothesize that there will be an association between sex and drug habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are as follows,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
H0: There is no association between sex and drug habits (sex and drug habits are independent),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ha: There is an association between sex and drug habits (sex and drug habits are dependent),,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Before formally testing the hypothesis, we will compare the differences in proportions between the categorizations within the drug variable among males and females",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The following figure displays a contingency table for proportion for each group,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As did the first two contingency tables, we can observe that males have higher proportions within every single drug category",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
These differences in proportion informally suggest a relationship between sex and drug habits,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As in our first two research scenarios, we assess our hypotheses with a formal inference for contingency tables",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Again, we are looking at the relationship between a categorical explanatory variable and a categorical response variable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, we will use the Chi-Square Test again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All of the formal conditions that must be met in order to use the Chi-Square Test have been discussed and justified in the first research question,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We carry out our test at alpha=0.05,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our Chi-Square Test produces a test statistic of Chi-Sq=5.9983, and a p-value of 0.1117",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Since the p-value is greater than 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and drug habits, and conclude that there is not sufficient evidence for a relationship between sex and drug habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In this project, we examine the possible relationships between sex and drinking, smoking, and drugs habits",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In all three scenarios, we did not obtain p-values that were less than our alpha level (0.05)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Therefore, we failed to obtain sufficient evidence required in order to reject our null hypotheses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Research has shown that on average, men tend to drink and smoke more, and use more drugs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Although our research does not align with the evidence of a relationship between sex and substance-use habits, we could infer that our volunteered sample produced bias within the data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Future research regarding this topic would need to use random sampling in order to eliminate bias and properly justify all the conditions required in order to use the Chi-Square Test,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
