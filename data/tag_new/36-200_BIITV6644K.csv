Introduction,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The desire for connection to others is one of the most driving forces of humanity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the modern age, the ability to connect has been made easier, in some respects",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
a prime example of this is dating sites,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"With the advent of platforms like OkCupid and Tinder, a person seeking a romantic partner no longer needs to frequently spend time at bars or ask friends to set up blind dates",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Rather, from the comfort of their own home, people can meet and interact with possible partners and begin relationships",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because so many people seek connection, a large amount of data can be collected from online dating profiles about the habits of a diverse population",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our primary goal is to better understand the demographic of people who seek out online dating platforms,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This report will examine age as a demographic on OkCupid profiles and analyze the relationship between age and other variables like income and drug usage,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Dataset,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The data set that will be explored in this report is a sample of a larger set of data collected, using Python, from San Francisco OkCupid (okcupid.com) public profiles of people who had been active within a year of the data collection, which occurred on June 30, 2012, and had at least one profile picture",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sample we will be using has a sample size of 1500 and 17 variable categories,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The primary variable that this report will be focusing on is age, which is a quantitative variable defined as the user’s age in years, as reported on their profile. Our sample mean is approximately 33 years, and our sample standard deviation is approximately 10 years",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The other variables involved in answering the research questions are income and drug use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Income is a quantitative variable that measures a persons income in US $,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The lowest value, other than those who do not wish to report, is 20,000, while the highest is 1,000,000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The sample mean for income is $102,340.00, and the sample standard deviation is approximately $195,774.73",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Drug use is a categorical variable defined as the frequency of which the user takes drugs, with the answers options being NA (answer not entered), never, sometimes, and often",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Research Questions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our first hypothesis will will involve the mean age of the profiles,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The variable of age was already somewhat explained in the Dataset section above,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For our usage here, the histogram of age (Figure 1) will be added below",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In the distribution, we observe that the age 30 seems to split the sample distribution in half (which is why we choose it as our hypothesis value), with a large concentration of users between 18 and 30, while a significant portion of the users make up the tale between 30 and 65",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The sample median for age is 31.00,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because of this, it seems probable that the population of users between 30 and 65 could make up a majority of the users",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"therefore, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the mean age of OkCupid users in San Francisco at the time of data collection is over 30 years old",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we have reason to believe the majority of users are over age 30, we will test the following hypothesis",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We can justify the use of a t-test for the distribution of age because of random sampling (assumed to be a random sample of n=1500 from the population), large population (59946>n=1500*30), and the distribution having no outliers (even though the distribution is skewed, the use of a t-test is still valid because of the large sample size and no outliers)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The test statistic is t=11.5972, and the p-value is reported as p=0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because our p-value is less than the significance level of alpha=0.05, then we have sufficient evidence to reject the null, that the true mean age is 30 years old, and that we have evidence for the alternative hypothesis, that the true mean age for the user is greater than 30 years old",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Our second hypothesis will involve a possible association between the quantitative variable age and the quantitative variable income,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"It seems reasonable to think that the older one gets, the more money they tend to make",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"After all, it seems reasonable to assume that someone in their 40s or 50s might have a more stable career and increased income compared to a person in their 20s, since they have had more time to develop their career",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, it could also depend on the career a person is in",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"For example, corporate careers have more opportunities for growth than a high school teaching career",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Also, depending on what age people retire, there may be a slight dip in the 60s-year range",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Below is the scatterplot and associated regression line for the relationship between age and income, based on the user profiles in the data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"We note that there are several y-axis outliers, where several users report income of $1,000,000, about 2 users that report an income of $500,000, and several report an income of a little more that $200,000",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, there seem to be a smaller concentration of users after age 50 in the graph",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, there seems to be a sufficiently linear, and have a very slightly negative slope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Below is the corresponding regression equation and the correlation coefficient,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The estimated slope, -411.58, suggests that for every year older a person is, they make around $411.58 less on average",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In justifying linearity, we can thus turn to the formal significance test for regression slope",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we have altered our hypothesis after analyzing the scatterplot, we now postulate that income tends to decrease as age decreases, we will use a one sided regression test for slope with an alternative of less than as follows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ha: beta1<0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where beta1 represents the true slope of the association between age and income, for the users of OkCupid in San Francisco",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In running the hypothesis test, we obtained a t-value of -0.8083 and a p-value of 0.419",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because this is much greater than our significance value of alpha=0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null, and thus do not have sufficient evidence to say that there is a negative relationship between age and income",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The third question is to analyze whether there is an association between drug use and age,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"As different age groups might have have different rates of risk taking behavior like drugs, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that, on average, different frequencies of drug-taking will have different mean age groups",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We can better see these possible differences in a chart as included below,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
This is a chart representation of the mean age of each category of drug taking frequency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The smallest, or youngest mean, is for the often category, with a mean of 26.900",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The largest, or oldest, mean is for the never category, which has a mean of 34.187",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is important to note that there are very different group sizes,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"notably, the often group has a size of n=20, while the other groups have a sample size of at least a couple hundred",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"To better understand the relationships between these means, we graphically investigate the relationship between drugs and age on a box plot",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In order to test whether there is a relationship between drug usage habits and age, we have to justify the use of an ANOVA test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because we have random sample, a sufficiently large population, and a sufficiently large sample size (n=1500>40), the smallest and largest sample standard deviations (7.159 and 10.410) are within a factor of two, and we are comparing means from independent populations, we can justify the use of an ANOVA test",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
We thus test the following hypothesis,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Where the mus indicate the true means of age in years for the four categories of drug usage frequency: never, sometimes, often, and null",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In running the ANOVA test, we receive a test statistic of F=22.5416 and a p-value of 0",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because this p-value is smaller than the significance level of alpha=0.05, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, that there is no relationship between the variable drugs and age, and have evidence for the alternative hypothesis, that there is a relationship between drugs and age",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Discussion,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Overall, we have evidence that the true mean of the user profiles’ age was greater than 30 year and that there is a relationship between drugs and age, but not that there was a relationship between age and income",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"These conclusions seem to suggest that the population of dating sites are not necessarily young adults, and that there might be evidence that the older a person is, the less likely they are to do recreational drugs",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"However, there are limitations to randomness of the data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Because they took the original population data from a website that requires volunteerism, there is a limited randomness in the population",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Thus, it seems reasonable to say that the conclusions gained from this data might not apply to the population of people seeking romantic connection in general",,,,,,,,,,,,,,
