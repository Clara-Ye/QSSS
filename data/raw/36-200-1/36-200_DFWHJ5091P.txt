Introduction:
As the internet evolves, people become more and more linked through social media platforms like Facebook and Youtube that allow us to be virtually connected. When it came out in “2005, YouTube is now one of the most popular sites on the Web, with visitors watching around 6 billion hours of video every month”(as reported by https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/youtube/what-is-youtube/1/). It offered people the ability to share videos and upload them to a single site for nearly anyone in the world with internet access to see. Youtube allows people to upload anything from home videos to news to professional productions with purposes ranging from entertainment to education. Each video collects views from every person that watches the video, thus increasing the popularity of the video allowing it to possible trend, and become even more popular. This report will give a detailed analysis of what factors influence views which can help anyone interested in possible becoming a Youtuber, or even a manager for someone else’s Youtube account.
Data:
We have information on a sample of 1259 different Youtube users (Youtubers).
The main focus of this report is on the analysis of viewsPerVideo, a quantitative variable that is the users total number of views divided by their total number of videos posted; the mean viewsPerVideo is 2,960,682 with a standard deviation of 8,332,162 viewsPerVideo.
The research question, as stated in the next section, is focusing on Category, Country, and Subscribers. Category is a categorical variable indicating which genre of videos the Youtube account posts (ie. gaming, entertainment). The most popular category is entertainment (517 out of the 1259 Youtubers sampled had a category of entertainment, making up 41% of the total sample) and Sports was the least popular (23 out of 1259 had sports as their category, making up only 2% of the sample). Country is a categorical variable that indicates what country from which the Youtube channel was created in. The most popular country is the United States (595 out of the 1259 users sampled were from the United States making up 47% of the sample) and the least popular country is Italy (8 out of 1259 users in the sample were from Italy, comprising 0.6% of the 1259 users). Subscribers is a quantitative variable that tells how many subscribers, or followers, a channel has. The mean subscriber count in the sample is about 3,201,758 with a standard deviation of 3,556,605 subscribers.
Our first research question will be looking at how a Youtube accounts category effects its viewsPerVideo and describing the relationship found. I hypothesize that certain categories receive more views on average as different people have different interests and some of those interests may be more common across a larger population.
This can be found by summarizing the relationship between the mean viewsPerVideo, the standard deviation, and the category.
As it can be seen in table one, on average videos in the Music and Education category receive more viewsPerVideo and Gaming and News & Politics have the least viewsPerVideo on average. Those in the Music and Gaming category also had a smaller standard deviation when compared to other categories, determining that it is more consistent in viewsPerVideo across accounts.
This research question deals with how the origin country of a youtube account effects thee viewsPerVideo. My hypothesis for this research question is that country will indeed effect viewPerVideo, as not many people or multilingual so they most likely watch videos majority from their country as it is their language. Further, Youtubers of the same country as a viewer are more relatable, thus making them more enticing to watch.
A summarization of the country and viewsPerVideo is show below
It can be seen in the table that on average those who have Youtube channels that originated in Egypt or the United states get more viewsPerVideo on average, however both have much larger standard deviations than those of other countries. Those countries with the lowest viewsPerVideo are Bangladesh and Pakistan, which both have lower standard deviations indicating that their viewsPerVideo are more consistent.
It can be seen in the plot above that the median viewsPerVideo in Egypt and the United States are higher, roughly in the 400,000-500,000 range. Further it can be seen that in Bangladesh and Pakistan the median viewsPerVideo is far lower than other countries, as it lies in the 350,000 to 430,000 viewsPerVideo range. It can be seen that although all countries have outliers, the United States, India, and Canada have the biggest outliers with videos that are over 20 million views above the median which would explain the higher means. It can also be seen that countries like the Republic of Korea, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates have higher interquartile ranges due to their medians being higher than most other countries.
Overall, it can be seen through a comparison of the mean viewsPerVideo and country as well as through the median and the country, that there is not enough evidence to determine a relationship. It would make sense that countries with bigger populations have bigger viewsPerVideo on average, however it can be seen through countries like India who have mean viewsPerVideo in the 1,600,000s with a population of over a billion and countries like the United States with mean viewsPerVideo around 4,000,000 with a population of roughly 350 million. Clearly the countries size is not a factor, nor is developmental factors. This can be seen through the fact that Japan is a developed country, yet has far less viewsPerVideo on average than Ukraine a developing country. Based on these pieces of evidence, it is safe to conclude that the country in which a youtube account was created does not directly effect viewsPerVideo.
My third and final research question is how a Youtuber’s subscriber count effects their viewsPerVideo and characterize the relationship if found. Although a videos goal is to get a lot of views, an accounts goal is to accumulate a lot of subscribers. It would make sense to hypothesize that the more subscribers a Youtuber has the more viewsPerVideo they get on average as they have more viewers that they know are interested in their content.
Further, it can be seen that the plot has a right skew. This can be noticed in the fact that the density toward the origin is far denser than as it moves away. The subscribers become more sparse as viewsPerVideo increase. Aside from that, we can see that the relationship appears sufficiently linear as the regression model is linear and the correlation coefficient is reasonably appropriate, we can then include the intercept and slope of the above regression as well as the correlation coefficients summarized in the tables below.
From the two tables above it can be seen that the subscriber coefficient is .3172. This represents the mean increase in viewsPerVideo from adding one subscriber. If the account’s subscribers increases by one subscriber, they will receive .3172 more views. Further, it can be seen in the correlation table (table 4), we can see that the correlation is .135 which shows a very weak relationship between the amount of subscribers and viewsPerVideo.
It can be determined that although it would seem like subscribers effect viewsPerVideo, the data does not support this hypothesis as the correlation between subscriber count and viewsPerVideo is very weak and can also be seen by the scatter plot that accounts with high subscribers have roughly the same viewsPerVideo as other accounts with less subscribers.
Discussion:
Our analysis focused on the viewsPerVideo within a sample of 1259 Youtubers to determine if a relationship between their category, country of origin, and subscriber count and viewsPerVideo. Overall, we were unable to see a strong relationship between viewsPerVideo and country of origin, as well as viewsPerVideo and subscriber count. However, there was a noticeable positive correlation between viewsPerVideo and the category in which a Youtuber’s content falls under. Those whose content falls under music or comedy had higher viewsPerVideo on average. This analysis was limited as viewsPerVideo can be thrown off by outliers such as trending videos which are videos that are more popular than the rest of a creators videos. A future analysis should most likely consider an accounts age to determine whether or not longer existing accounts tend to get more viewsPerVideo in comparison to newer accounts. This would allow us to take into account the fact that some people are getting more viewsPerVideo because more people are joining Youtube during their prime. Further, we may want to analyze total views in order to figure out whether their viewsPerVideo average was thrown off by a video that was more or less popular than the others.
In conclusion, this analysis can help Youtubers who already exist or are starting up learn how to maximize their viewsPerVideo.
