Introduction: Youtube is an online video-sharing website that was created in 2005.,,,
"The site currently has over 2.3 billion users, which is almost 80% of all internet users (as reported by YouTube, https://www.youtube.com/intl/en-GB/about/press/).",,,
"Many content creators join Youtube in the hopes of becoming “Youtube Famous,” a term that refers to gaining multiple subscribers and viewers on a particular channel.",,,
The success of a YouTube channel can be determined by its number of subscribers as they tend to spend more time watching your channel than viewers who are not subscribed.,,,
"Additionally, subscribers can be seen as loyal viewers as they have selected to follow your channel's feed.",,,
People who can also share your videos with their friends or on social media to help gain more subscribers for your channel.,,,
The goal of this work is to better understand Subscribers and to help YouTube channels use this to their advantage in terms of monitoring their statistics and online presence.,,,
"Dataset: The data represents 1259 different Youtube accounts, collected by Social Blade up to 2018, that illustrates variables such as how old the YouTube account is, how often an account post, the number of subscribers and views, etc.",,,
"The primary variable in this paper will be a quantitative variable, Subscribers, as the number of subscribers is most important to Youtubers because it determines the success of their channel.",,,
Subscribers refer to the number of people who follow a Youtube channel.,,,
"The least amount of subscribers from the data is 107,329 and the highest is 27,765,423 subscribers, with a mean of 1,949,612 subscribers and a standard deviation of 3,556,605 subscribers.",,,
"Our research questions will focus on three additional variables: Category, Continent, and Views.",,,
Category is a categorical variable that specifies the user-defined channel topic.,,,
Continent is a categorical variable that refers to the place of origin where the Youtube account was created.,,,
Views is a quantitative variable that measures the total amount of views a YouTube channel has.,,,
There are 5 different continents and 9 various categories.,,,
"The mean number of views is 1,346,843,185, the median is 675,927,454.",,,
"The lowest number of views is 593,861 and the highest is 24,518,098,041.",,,
Relationship between Subscribers and Views This research question investigates the relationship between the number of subscribers and the number of views a Youtube account has.,,,
We hypothesize that the more subscribers an account has usually correlated to more views creating a positive linear relationship.,,,
"This could be concluded from the fact that subscribers get notified when an account they follow posts a video, and therefore, are more likely to watch the video.",,,
"The more subscribers an account has, they can expect to have more views on their videos.",,,
Figure 2 could also be useful for YouTuber’s to determine how many views they should be getting given their subscriber account.,,,
One way this could be helpful is to compare how they are doing compared to the linear regression line to see if they are above or below the line.,,,
"Using the linear regression output, we can obtain the equation for the linear regression line.",,,
Where ŷ is the amount of views and x is the amount of subscribers.,,,
We can use this equation to estimate how many views an account will have based on the amount of subscribers they have.,,,
"For example, if an account has 15 million subscribers, they should expect to have around: It is important to note that the intercept is quite large, at around 1,397,654 subscribers.",,,
"Therefore, it is hard to generalize this equation to accounts that have subscribers less than that or if these smaller accounts withhold the same type of relationship between subscribers and views.",,,
The next research question involves investigating the popularity of YouTube accounts Categories amongst the continents.,,,
Many YouTubers struggle with finding content that not only their subscribers will like but also coming up with unique or original content that can help attract more views and subscribers.,,,
"Knowing if certain categories strive more than others in the users continent, will be helpful information when creating their YouTube videos or coming up with content.",,,
This can also be useful for Youtube channels to see how much competition they have in their Category.,,,
We hypothesis that the distribution of categories will be fairly equal across all continents.,,,
A contingency table can help illustrate the distribution of the Category of content based on the Continent of the Youtube account.,,,
The findings are useful for Youtubers to see the type of content other YouTubers make in their continent.,,,
"For example, an American Youtuber might look at the table and see how few accounts are based on News & Politics.",,,
They could use this to their advantage and start making content on News & Politics.,,,
"Even though Entertainment might be the most popular category, it also means there is a lot of competition for the Youtuber in terms of getting more subscribers or views.",,,
"On the other hand, it also means that Entertainment channels could be most popular amongst the viewers/subscribers.",,,
Our next Research Question will examine the relationship between each Category in terms of their number of Subscribers.,,,
"From our previous research question, we learned that there are big differences in terms of Category popularity amongst the Continents.",,,
"We hypothesis that since categories such as Entertainment hold 41% of all categories, these top categories will also have the most amount of subscribers compared to other categories.",,,
A box plot is most appropriate to determine this relationship as the Categories are categorical data and the amount of Subscribers is quantitative data.,,,
"Additionally, side-by-side boxplots will help YouTubers compare and visualize the multiple distributions and determine if a certain category gains more subscribers than other categories.",,,
"From the side box plots, there seems to be no major difference between the number of subscribers a category has as the box plots seem to overlap.",,,
The lowest mean views belong to Sports with 1.3 million views.,,,
Comedy has the highest mean with 2.9 million views.,,,
Comedy also has the largest interquartile range of around 3.9 million subscribers.,,,
Each category has multiple outliers present.,,,
"Entertainment has the most outliers, also the largest outlier of 27.7 million subscribers.",,,
All box plots are skewed to the right and all medians are closer to the first quartile than they are to the third quartile.,,,
This disproves our hypothesis as there is no clear relationship between the subscribers each category contains.,,,
This helps YouTubers understand that there is a market with many subscribers present in each category.,,,
Discussion: The analysis focused on a sample of 1259 YouTube accounts collected in 2018 from Social Blade.,,,
"The positive linear relationship between Subscribers and Views demonstrates that the more Subscribers a YouTube account has, the more views they will have as well.",,,
The majority of accounts were made in America.,,,
Entertained proved to be the most popular Category in all Continents while Sports was among the least popular.,,,
"Additionally, we noticed that there was no correlation between the number of Subscribers in each Category.",,,
Limitations from this study are that the vast majority of the chosen YouTube accounts are large as the amount of views/subscribers the accounts had were very high.,,,
"Therefore, it is hard to generalize these findings to accounts with smaller amounts of views or subscribers.",,,
"Additionally, the data collected was up to 2018.",,,
The content has changed tremendously in the last three years and therefore the data would need to be updated to check if the same findings apply.,,,
"For example, Coronavirus has caused a lot of users to check for updates on news channels on YouTube or the US Presidential Election has caused users to watch political-related videos, therefore increasing the popularity of the News & Politics channels.",,,
"Thus, future research could investigate the research questions mentioned and see how the findings differ from year to year.",,,
"Additionally, considering that findings are only from 1259 YouTube accounts, which is around 5% of all YouTube accounts, it would be interesting for data analysts to explore the same research questions on a larger, more representative, data set to investigate if there are any differences in the findings.",,,
