"Introduction: In the cases of many, poor health comes from a misfortunate draw of one’s genes.",,,
This prompts the debate of whether or not health insurance premiums are effective and fair to patients whose lives are already facing turbulence due to their illnesses.,,,
Heart disease is widely recognized as the ‘silent killer’ in the United States and this is with reason.,,,
"Heart disease causes one in four deaths within the United States, approximately killing one person every 36 seconds, and is the leading cause of death (as recorded by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Sept. 8, 2020: https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm).",,,
A notable amount of ill people in the United States are victims of heart disease and require serious treatment.,,,
"Our goal in this work is to analyze and understand the relationship between a patient with heart disease, their medical history, and the price they pay for a health insurance premium.",,,
This work may be of help to those suffering of heart disease in understanding what factors may be raising their health insurance premium.,,,
Data: This analysis will be using a sample of 788 health insurance subscribers who suffer from ischemic heart disease from January 1998 to December 1999.,,,
"Our primary focus will be on the variable cost, a qualitative variable measuring how much the health insurance subscribers within the sample are paying for their premium (measured in dollars); the mean cost was $2,799.96, and the standard deviation of the cost was $6,690.26.",,,
"Our work’s research questions [presented in the following section] will also include gender, comorbidities, complications, and age.",,,
The variable gender is a categorical variable which states the gender of an insurance subscriber.,,,
"A majority of the sample used consisted of women (608 subscribers were women, making up around 77.2% of the sample) while the minority consisted of men (180 subscribers were men, making up around 22.8% of the sample).",,,
"Comorbidities is a quantitative variable measuring the number of other diseases a subscriber had; the mean quantity of comorbidities was 3.766, and the standard deviation was 5.951.",,,
"The variable complications is a categorical variable measuring whether or not the subscriber had complications (recorded as 1 if Yes, 0 if No).",,,
"A majority of the subscribers had no complications (745 or around 95% of subscribers had no complications, while the other 43 or 15% of subscribers had complications.",,,
"Age is a quantitative variable measuring the age of the subscriber (measured in years); the mean age was 58.718, and the standard deviation was 6.754.",,,
"Our first research question is to assess whether health insurance premium costs differ in men and women with ischemic heart disease, and whether comorbidities play a role in the situation.",,,
"Based on anecdotal evidence, we hypothesize that costs do not differ between men and women.",,,
We assume this as there are no evident and significant differences between male and female patients.,,,
"We also hypothesize that comorbidities may increase insurance cost, but without relating to a specific.",,,
gender.,,,
"Table 1, depicted below, displays the mean and standard deviation of health insurance premium costs in men and women.",,,
"As shown in table 1, above, we notice there is a notable increase in the mean and standard deviation of female insurance costs as compared to those of men.",,,
"The mean insurance cost for men is 89.7% of the mean cost for women, and the standard deviation is 88.3% of the value for women.",,,
This contradicts our hypothesis that premium costs are relatively similar between men and women.,,,
"We investigated the relationship between comorbidities and gender to see whether a relation to the price difference may be found with a histogram, as shown in figure 1, below: While we do notice a difference in the amount of comorbidities between men and women, there is not enough evidence for comorbidities to be understood as the sole cause for the price difference in premium costs between the genders.",,,
"However, comorbidities may play a smaller role in stacking up the premium cost gap between men and women.",,,
Our second research question is to investigate whether there is a relationship between premium costs and complications.,,,
"Since complications generally require additional hospital resources, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that premium costs will be higher in patients of heart disease if they have had complications as health insurance companies will need to spend more money on them.",,,
"To begin, we magnify the relationship between cost and complications with side by side vertical boxplots, as shown in figure 2, below: The difference in premium costs between patients with complications and no complications follows our hypothesis that premium costs are higher for patients with complications.",,,
"Of the 788 subscribers in the sample, only 43 or around 5.46% of the sample had complications.",,,
This is not enough to prove our theory since the size of patients with complications was not remotely close to the size of those with no complications.,,,
The third research question is to investigate whether the age of a patient with ischemic heart disease affects the insurance premium cost.,,,
"Based on anecdotal evidence, we hypothesize that as a patient gets older, their premium cost will increase.",,,
This seems reasonable as it could be assumed that more complications and issues may arise when a patient is older and their body loses strength.,,,
"Therefore, health insurance companies will increase prices as more will have to be spent.",,,
"Figure 3, shown below, is a scatterplot with a regression model displaying the age of patients (as the explanatory variable) and the premium cost of health insurance (as the response variable).",,,
"As displayed in figure 3, above, there is a minimally downward trend in health insurance premium costs as the age of a patient increases.",,,
"Our hypothesis that premium costs increase with a patient’s age was is not supported by the figure above, as it possesses a negative slope.",,,
"However, this scatterplot doesn’t necessarily show a decreasing relationship with premium costs as age increases.",,,
Figure 3 mainly suggests that there is no correlation between age and premium cost in patients with ischemic heart disease.,,,
"Discussion: Our analysis focused on health insurance premium costs for subscribers with ischemic heart disease from the date January 1998 to December 1999 and investigated relationships with gender, comorbidities, complications, age, and premium costs.",,,
"Our study found that there was a prevalent increase in premium costs for women in the sample, while men tended to have lower premium costs.",,,
"However, the sample used in our study was made up of a 77.2% female majority and 22.8% male minority.",,,
This causes distrust within our sample as it was not proportional and may have contained irregularities.,,,
"While expanding this result we found that women tend to have more comorbidities than men, which may be contributing to this gap in premium costs.",,,
"We also investigated the relationship between premium costs and complications, and found that patients in the sample who had complications had much higher premium costs than those who didn’t.",,,
Our final research question expanded on the relationship between premium costs and age.,,,
"Unlike our hypothesis, we seemed to find no specific correlation within the subject.",,,
"In the future, our study could be expanded by magnifying complications within ischemic heart disease.",,,
"By doing so, we can see what specific factors are causing more complications in patients and raising premium costs.",,,
"A more proportional and fair sample should be used in a future study: one with similar gender ratios, complication ratios, and general equity.",,,
"Through similarly spreading awareness of the topic, hopefully we can help reduce premium costs for those already struggling with heart disease.",,,
