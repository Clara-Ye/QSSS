Introduction: Youtube is a growing online video-sharing platform that allows users to watch videos posted by other users or upload their own.,,,
Millions of users are using this platform to make money.,,,
"To be able to generate the income you are required to have enough views on your videos and subscribers, but most people who try to generate their income through youtube aren’t successful because they do not know the type of content that people want to watch.",,,
( as reported in Medium May.,,,
"05, 2020: https://medium.com/illumination/why-so-many-people-fail-on-youtube-youtube-failures-217ca3c8a67).",,,
Our goal is therefore to understand the categories which attract more people on youtube.,,,
This will help the user to know where they can start if they want to make money on youtube and what type of content is being viewed on youtube.,,,
"Data: We have a dataset of 1259 youtube channels with their category, country, account age, videoUploads, subscribers, views, viewsPervideo and continent.",,,
"Our main focus will be on the categories of these youtube channels, the number of subscribers to the channel, and The total views across the channels.",,,
"the variable category is a categorical variable for User-defined channel topic, views quantitative variable which measure The total views across all videos, and subscribers which measure the number of subscribers to the channel.",,,
"Based on the above frequency table entertainment with 517 channels is the most frequent category among the channels in the dataset, and sport with 23 channels as the least frequent in dataset.",,,
"From this summary statistics, Views has the mean of 1,346,843,185.94 and median of 675,927,454 and standard deviation is 2,036,809,998.695.",,,
Subscribers have a mean of 3201757.576 and median 1949612 and standard deviation of 3556605.298.,,,
Our first question will be to know the most popular category and the distribution of categories across different channels.,,,
"based on a simple google search, we are expecting it to be comedy, music, entertainment/pop culture, or ""how to”.",,,
By the use of a Bar chart below.,,,
"We observe that entertainment is the most frequent category with about 517 channels, followed by music with 204 channels and gaming with 127 channels.",,,
"Our initial hypothesis that the most frequent category will be between comedy, music, entertainment/pop culture, or ""how to” was nearly true based on our result because we found that entertainment and music are among the most frequent categories on youtube.",,,
"Our next research question is to investigate the most viewed category on youtube if it similar to the most frequent category across different channels.From the above question, we expect entertainment to be a channel with more views since it is a more frequent category.",,,
"This bar chart shows that in terms of the most viewed category music is the most frequent one with about 1.61 billion views, followed by entertainment with 1.41 Billion views and film and Animation with 1.37 billion views.",,,
Perhaps this is due to the fact that most people listen to music using YouTube as their main platform and they can still listen to music while doing other work hence having more views compared to other categories.,,,
There is also one more category that has more views and less content which is film and animation it has 92 channels but it has 1.37 billion views which might be a room of expansion if you are looking for categories with more views with less content.,,,
We further investigate the distribution of views among categories using side by side box-plots.,,,
"From the above graph, there is a noticeable outlier on entertainment categories which make sense why people might want to create more content in the same categories because some people are getting more views expecting to get similar results.",,,
"Moreover, film and animation, gaming has also some significant outlier which might be the reason why we see more views in these categories because of this outliers.",,,
Also we see that Music has the highest maximum and median compared to others which might be the reason why it come as the first one with more views in different categories.,,,
"Overall, even though there entertainment is not the most viewed category on youtube it is clear that the most viewed categories still fall under relaxation and entrainment, which shows that most people goes on youtube for relation and entertainment and that’s why the most viewed and the common category falls under the same conclusion.",,,
Our last research question is to investigate if there is a relationship between subscribers and category because the subscribers is the basis of monetarizing your account youtube.,,,
"Therefore, we believe it is important to check if there is the relationship between them.",,,
"Based on the regression of subscribe the slope is 0.0013 which implies that the rate of change is really small, and even though we have a high positive correlation of 0.767.",,,
This high correlation might be due to different outliers that are found in this data because most of the data are spread between 0 and 5 billions based on the linear regression model.,,,
There is still small change based slope because for each increase in subscribers there is almost zero change in views.,,,
"Therefore, it is really had to tell if there is a relationship between views and subscribers.",,,
we will need more information about what type of views who viewed a video if they are subscribers or viewers.,,,
"Overall, we can not make conclusion about the relationship between subscribers and categories because for example entertainment dropped to the fifth position based on the subscriber vs views on the second position, for this question further investigations need to be made to be sure about the results.",,,
"Discussion: Our analysis focused on categories for a sample of 1259 youtube channels in 2018 and examined potential categories worthy of investments based on the frequency of categories with channels, the relationship of categories with views and subscribers.",,,
"Overall, we found that most people are using YouTube for relaxation and entertainment, hence it is worth investing in these categories ( entertainment, music, gaming, film, and animation).",,,
We didn’t find a clear relationship between categories and subscribers as it contradicted the previous question and more data was needed to confirm if there is a relationship.,,,
"Future analysis might include the type of viewers if they are subscribers or non-subscribers, also how long someone has watched a certain video for better analysis.",,,
"Overall, our analysis can help youtube users who are willing to start making money through youtube to make a good decision on what type of content can generate more money based on views, and we recommend them to generate content for relaxation and entertainment.",,,
