Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
"Our client, Preston Jorgensen, is interested in extending his life by examining the relationship between pollutants and death rate",Context,RQSig,,Intro,?
Doctors and epidemiologists belive that air pollution is an important factor contributing to death rate in Chicago,Context,RQSig,,Intro,
"For example, Ozone and particulate matter in the city's atmosphere is known to cause damage to lungs whereas sulfure dioxide contributes to acid rain in Chicago",Context,RQSig,,Intro,
"Therefore, throughout this research paper, we are going to investigate if there is a relationship between air pollutatant and death rate in the given data, Chicago",RQDef,,,Intro,
The data contains several air quality measurements in Chicago from January 1987 to December 2000 with death rate of each day,DataDesc,,,Intro,
"It contains 5,114 observations and main 6 variables with 4 additional lag variables for pollutants and temperature",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"The data include potential explanatory variables such as number of non-accidental death each day, the median density of PM10 pollution(mg/m^3) which is a particle with diameter less than 10 micrometers, the median concentration of ozone(parts per billion), median concentration of sulfur dioxide, and the mean temperature of the day(Fahrenheit)",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"These variables are represented as 03median, so2median, pm10median, tmpdmedian in dataset",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"Four more additional varaibles indicated by 'lag' in front of temperature, sulfure dioxide concentration median, O3 concentration median, and PM10 median which takes average values 7 days of these variables prior up to date(2)",DataDesc,,,Intro,
There are 3 main ressearch questions we address in this report,Struct,,,Intro,
We investigated in EDA and modelling sections to find out whether there is a relationship between pollutants and mortality,RQDef,,,Intro,
"If there is a relationship, then we will try to find pollutants that is most strongly associated with mortality",RQDef,,,Intro,
With lag varaibles we will also research if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or extend over time,RQDef,,,Intro,
"Lastly, we will try to predict the mortality rate given lowest level of pollutants recorded to check if there is any meaningful decrease in mortaility rate(1)",RQDef,,,Intro,
Our report and analysis concluded that there is an association between pollutants and mortality,ResInf,IntVar,,Intro,
"Especially, the most associated pollutant with death appears to be Ozone",IntVar,,,Intro,
"However, as we are working wtih observational data, we cannot assume casuality between pollutants and death rate",IntImp,LimAna,,Intro,
There are several limitations to this research mentioned in conclusion,Struct,,,Intro,
I hope this research shed some light into relationship between air pollution and mortality,RQSig,,,Intro,?
Exploratory Data Analysis,Title,,,Data,
There are total of 9 key variables to consider,DataDesc,,,Data,
The response variable is the death rate each day in Chicago(2),DataDesc,,,Data,
"Other 8 variables are potential explanatory varaiables including temperature in Fahernheit, O3 median in parts per billion, SO2 concentration median, PM10 median in mg/m^3 with their 'lag' values(1)",DataDesc,,,Data,
We are going to try to fit the model using general additive model which implies we need to consider the reponse variable as log(death rate)(2),MethDef,MethJust,,Data,
Let's examine univariate distributions of response and explanatory variables,Struct,,,Data,
Figure 1 below shows the univariate distribution of explantory variables without lag,Struct,,,Data,
The reason we are exploring the univariate distribution of original data is lag variables are average of these varaibles,MethJust,,,Data,
"Therefore, their distribution appears very similar although figures not shown",MethJust,,,Data,
Both PM10 and SO2 concentration median are heavily right skewed with mean 0.263677 mg/m^3 and 0.6621939 parts by billion,DataStat,,,Data,
O3 median is also right skewed but not as much as these two variables with mean 2.024481 parts by billion,DataStat,,,Data,
"Temperature, on the other hand, shows slightly left skewed distribution(1) with mean 114.984 fahernheit",DataStat,,,Data,
The distribution of the log of response variable is shown by the Figure 2,Struct,,,Data,
The distribution is skewed slightly to the right with mean log(death) of 4.744793,DataStat,,,Data,
"Notice that the log of response appears approximately normal, thus no transformation is necessary",DataStat,MethJust,,Data,
Let's explore the relationship between the response and explanatory variables,Struct,,,Data,
"As the Figure 3 below shows, there does not seem to exist relationship between these varaibles",DataStat,,,Data,
"However, there seems to be very weak negative relationship between temperature and log of death",DataStat,,,Data,
Note there are some outliers towrads the right extreme end of temperature which seems to match with the ourliers around 1995 when scorch hit,DataStat,IntImp,,Data,
"When Examining the death rate over time in Chicago, there were apparent outliers around 1995 shown by the Figure4 below",DataStat,,,Data,
The fluctuating trend in the figure represents the changes in weather,DataStat,IntVar,,Data,
It seems to suggest that there might be some association between seaons and death rate,IntVar,,,Data,
In fact in July 1995 there was a scorch of three days which resulted in killing 739 people dead,IntImp,Context,,Data,???
These outliers can be kept as it is explained by tempreature(3),MethJust,MethDef,,Data,
"Furthermore, I researched on whether there is a relationship between explanatory variables",RQDef,,,Data,???
"Especially, I was interested in relationship bewteen temperature and other covariates",RQDef,,,Data,???
There seem to be a positive non linear relationship between temperature and O3 median,DataStat,,,Data,
PM10 also showed a positive non-linear relationship with temperature with much less degree(4),DataStat,,,Data,
"On the other hand, there seems to be no relationship with SO2",DataStat,,,Data,
Figure 5 demonstrates this postive relationships,Struct,,,Data,
"From above, it seems that the level of pollution might depend on temperature due to changes in air movement",IntVar,IntImp,,Data,?
"To further examine, I looked into the trend of pollutants over the given time interval",Struct,,,Data,
"Surprisingly, the trend of temperature was very similar to the trend in PM10 and O3",DataStat,,,Data,
"In other words, the fluctuating trend and points match with the trend in temperature with varying degree (5)",DataStat,,,Data,
PM10 most closely resembled the trend in O3 wehreas PM10 was scaled to small size,DataStat,,,Data,
This may suggest that temperature may not only has direct affect on death but also can contribute to other pollutant factors to affect the mortality rate,IntVar,IntImp,,Data,?
Modeling & Diagnostics,Title,,,RS,
We are going to explore the key relationship through two models which are based on general additive model,MethDef,,,RS,
Model1 uses covariates that are not 'lagged' and model2 only inlcudes covariates with 'lagged' term,MethDef,,,RS,
spline smoother terms were applied to all covariates,MethDef,,,RS,
"For simplicity, I used 4 degrees of freedom for all spline terms",MethDef,,,RS,
"These two models are, $$ model1 : beta_0 + s(PM) + s(O3) + s(SO2) + S(temperature) $$ $$ model2 : beta_0 + s(lagPM) +s(lag O3) + s(lagSO2) + s(lag.temperature) $$",MethDef,,,RS,
"Model summary (not shown) suggests that in model1, all variables are significant except SO2",ResInf,,,RS,
"On the other hand, model2 find all varaibles to be significant",ResInf,,,RS,
"As a result, the deviance explained in model1 is 19.8% which is lower than that of model2, 25.9%",ResInf,,,RS,?
"For both models, I am going to use 5-fold cross validation to calculate errors in both models to ensure there is enough data size in each fold for better accuracy",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
MSE for model1 is 0.01328419 and for model2 is 0.0124551(2),MethJust,,,RS,
Standard errors are 0.0003846972 for model1 and 0.0002719527 for model2,MethJust,,,RS,
The table below summarizes the result,Struct,,,RS,
"Therefore, in terms of MSE, model2 performed better than model1 but the difference in MSE is rather minimal(3)",MethJust,,,RS,
"Since model2 is still better than model1, we are going to continue using model2(3)",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
Results,Title,,,RS,
(1)We conducted global chi-goodness-of-fit test on model2 to assess how well the model fits,MethDef,,,RS,
The p-value turned out to be 0,ResInf,,,RS,
"The value 0 suggests that there is significant evidence to rejects model2 in favor of a ""saturated"" model with 4 degrees of freedom",IntVar,MethJust,,RS,?
We compared model2 with the model that only uses temperature using hypothesis test,MethJust,,,RS,???
The temperature modle is fitted using poisson GAM with 4 degrees of freedom uing only temperature,MethDef,,,RS,
Chi-square anova test produced p-value of 2.2e-16 which implies the difference between the temperature model and model2 is significant and we reject the null hypothesis(2),ResInf,MethJust,MethDef,RS,?
"In Modeling section, we discussed that MSE of model2, which uses lagged variables, is better than model1 although the difference is minimal(3)",MethDef,Struct,,RS,???
"Furthermore, it makes sense that effects of pollutants over time is better estimate for death compared to single-day pollutant data",MethDef,,,RS,?????
Now we analyzed which covariate is associated the most to death rate through partial response function represented by the Figure 6,RQDef,,,RS,?
"As the curve suggests, we observe that the most curved variable is O3",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Therefore, we inferred that O3 is the most associated factor for death(4)",IntVar,,,RS,
"On the other hand, lagged temperature showed the most flat curve which implies that the temperature is less associated with the death rate",ResDesc,IntVar,,RS,
lagged PM10 median and pagged SO2 median displays similar convexity,ResDesc,,,RS,
Further note that this matches with the summary of models where p-value of Ozone was the smallest,ResInf,,,RS,???
We also calculated the predicted value and its 95% confidence interval with the minimal observed values in the data before NA observations were removed,MethDef,,,RS,
With observed minimal values of pollutants with fixed temperature of 70 predicted 114.8476 death(5),ResInf,,,RS,
"95% confidence interval returned [106.3248,124.0535] (5)",ResInf,,,RS,
Residaul diagnosis was examined represented by the Figure7,Struct,,,RS,?
There are noticeable 4 ourliers in both residuals plot and QQ-plot of model2,MethJust,,,RS,
"However, these residauls do not affect the 'fittness' because they are consistent with 4 outliers mentioned in EDA during heat wave in 1995",MethJust,,,RS,
The residuals seems constant and normality assumption seems to hold as well although there is a slight deviation in both tails,MethJust,,,RS,
"Therefore, it seems that our residuals are normally distributed which leads us to use parametric bootstrapping method to compare 95% confidence interval",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"Parametric bootstrapping produced 95% confidence interval of [106.0964,124.3239] which is very similar to one we got before(6)",ResInf,MethDef,,RS,
"The difference between 2 confidence interval is minimal, suggesting they seem support that data may be from poisson distributiion with errors coming from normal distribution(7)",IntVar,,,RS,???
Conclusions,Title,,,Discuss,
(1)Throughout the research we found that there is an association between pollutants mentioned and death rate,ResInf,,,Discuss,
Hypothesis test was conducted to conclude that there is significant statistical evidence to support the model with pollutants over model with only temperature,MethDef,MethJust,,Discuss,
Further testing with cross-validation with 5 fold revealed that the model with lagged variables perform better than the model with original variable based on MSE,MethDef,MethJust,,Discuss,
It means that effects of pollutants extend over time,IntVar,,,Discuss,
Comparison with parametric bootstrapping 95% confidence interval confirmed that our assumptions on the model2 are correct,MethDef,MethJust,,Discuss,
"However, keep in mind that MSE difference bewteen two models is rather small",LimAna,,,Discuss,Int???
"With our best model2, we predicted the death rate using the minimal observed value in the data with temperature set to 70 to answer Jorgensen's question",RQDef,,,Discuss,IntImp?
The prediction returned 114.8476 which is included in our confidence intervals,ResInf,,,Discuss,
It seems that spending a fortune to decrease is not recommended because our prediction is not a lot lower than the median death which is 114,IntImp,,,Discuss,
"Furthermore, as stated before, this study is based on observational data which means we can't conclude decreasing pollutants will lead to decrease in mortality rate",IntImp,LimAna,,Discuss,
There are some limitations to address in this research,Struct,,,Discuss,
"In processing data, we removed all observations that contain NA value",LimAna,,,Discuss,
This decreased the size of the data we fit our models,LimAna,,,Discuss,
"Furthermore, the dataset is specific to one region, Chicago",LimData,,,Discuss,
"Therefore, it is hard to extrapolate meaningful conclusion from region specific research to globally",LimData,,,Discuss,
Dataset with various regions and locations could enrich the research in the future,FuWork,,,Discuss,
