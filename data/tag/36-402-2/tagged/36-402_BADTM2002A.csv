Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
"(1) We are trying to see if pollutants are associated with increased mortality, if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or not, and if Jorgensen should spend his fortune trying to reduce pollution",RQDef,,,Intro,
"(2) We are using chicago.csv, which are measurements of air quality in Chicago from January 1987 to December 2000",DataDesc,,,Intro,
(3) We found that is a relationship between pollutants and increased mortality,ResInf,,,Intro,
"However, reducing the pollutants in an area may not necessarily decrease mortality",IntImp,,,Intro,
We also found that the effects of the pollutants are lagged or extended over time,IntVar,,,Intro,?
Exploratory Data Analysis,Title,,,Data,
(1) A sample of one of the predictors (ozone) shows that the dataset is fairly normal,DataStat,DataDesc,,Data,
The summary shows that there may be a few outliers to look at later,DataStat,,,Data,
"(2) In figure 3, we see that the distribution of log deaths in Chicago is fairly normal and we can proceed with the use of this response variable",DataStat,MethJust,MethDef,Data,???
"(3) We see that in figure 4, there was an outlier in 1995",DataStat,,,Data,
This was likely due to a heat wave that occured during this time period,IntImp,,,Data,
(5) We will have to observe the use of the outlier due to the heat wave as we move forward,Other,,,Data,?
Modeling & Diagnostics,Title,,,RS,
"(1) (2) Model 2 has better performance as it has a prediction error of 186, lower than model 1's 200",MethJust,,,RS,
"(3) The difference between the models is approximately 14, which is a somewhat large difference",MethJust,,,RS,
"Although we have not done a formal test to see if it is a significant difference, we would pick model 2 to use for our results",MethDef,,,RS,
Results,Title,,,RS,
"(1) Using model 2, we will conduct a global goodness-of-fit test",MethDef,,,RS,
We see that there is no significant evidence to reject our chosen model,MethJust,,,RS,
(2) Model 2's p-value is low and the deviance is 236.59 which means that model 2 is a better fit,MethJust,,,RS,
Using just temperature as a feature and not the pollutants is not a better model,MethJust,,,RS,
(3) Model 2 uses lagged terms and it has a lower prediction error than the other models we have observed,ResDesc,,,RS,
We can conclude that pollution effects extend over time and are not instantaneous,IntVar,,,RS,???
(4) Ozone appears to be the most associated with mortality,IntVar,,,RS,
"(5) The mean number of deaths is estimated to be 110.3491 with a 95% confidence interval between [106.9241, 113.7740]",ResInf,,,RS,
(6) We ran 1000 bootstrap simulations to estimate the number of deaths on a 70 degree day,MethDef,,,RS,
"We found a mean of 110.382 with a confidence interval between [105.933, 115.1852]",ResInf,,,RS,
(7) There is not much difference as both estimate 110 deaths,ResInf,,,RS,
"However, the bootstrap estimates a wider 95% confidence interval",ResInf,,,RS,
Conclusions,Title,,,Discuss,
"(1) We saw that in our selected model (m2), there appears to be an association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality",ResInf,,,Discuss,
"All three pollutant terms were significant and when only using temperature as a predictor, we saw that our selected model with pollutants included was better",ResInf,MethDef,,Discuss,
"Therefore, we must assume some relationship between pollutants and mortality",IntVar,,,Discuss,
"(2) Although it appears that a lower amount of pollutants would estimate lower deaths compared to non-accidental deaths on any given day (110 vs 114), we cannot confirm that reducing the pollutants would actually cause mortality to decrease",ResInf,IntImp,,Discuss,
"We simply followed associations between observable data but did not conduct an experiment ourselves, showing better data on cause-effect relationships",LimAna,,,Discuss,
(3) We did not remove some outliers which may have affected the dataset,LimAna,MethDef,,Discuss,
