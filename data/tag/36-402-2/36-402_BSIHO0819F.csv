Introduction,,,,,
Billionaire Preston Jorgensen is interested in discovering which pollutants are associated with increased deaths to learn how to extend his lifespan,,,,,
"textbf{(1)} Specifically, the research questions proposed are: Is there evidence that pollutants are associated with increased mortality, and which ones have the strongest association",,,,,
"Further, does the effect of pollution happen instantaneously or is there a certain time window that the effect occurs",,,,,
"Lastly, how would the death rate change for Chicago on a 70 degree day if, theoretically, the levels of each pollutant were lowered to the record-lows",,,,,
"textbf{(2)} To answer these questions, we will be using data with the measurements of air quality in Chicago, Illinois beginning in January 1987 to December 2000",,,,,
"Each measurement countains a `time`, time it was taken, `death`, the number of non-accidental deaths on that day, `pm10median`, the median density of PM-10 pollution, `o3median`, the median concentration of ozone, `so2median`, the median concentration of sulfur dioxide, adn the temperatures",,,,,
"To answer Jorgesen's questions, we modeled multiple models to predict the death rate using our observations of air quality",,,,,
"textbf{(3)} We found that some pollutants have a stronger association, the ozone concentration and the sulfur dioxide concentration, with the mortality rate and an increase in these pollutants are associated with an increase in non-accidental deaths",,,,,
We also found that the effect on mortality is not instaneous but rather extends over time to weeks after the initial exposure to certain levels of pollutants,,,,,
"Lastly, we predicted that the death rate for Chicago on a 70 degree day with record lows of each pollutant would be around 107",,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,
We will begin our data exploration by looking at the univariate for each of the variables in the dataset,,,,,
"Note that the time variable has been converted to a date object, `date` for visualization purposes",,,,,
"textbf{(1)} In Figure 1, we can see the histograms for each variable",,,,,
"The `date` variable has an almost uniform distribution but a drop in observations at around 1989, with values randing from 1987 to 2000",,,,,
"`death` appears to have a unimodal shape with a peak around 120 deaths, with outliers in the higher extremes",,,,,
"`pm10median` has a slightly right skewed distribution, and a unimodal shape as well with a peak at 0 milligrams per cubic meter",,,,,
"`o3median` appears to be right skewed, with a peak at around 0 parts per billion",,,,,
"`so2median` is also skewed right and unimodal at 0, but with a smaller range of values",,,,,
"Lastly, `tmpd` looks to be almost bimodal at 35 degrees and 70 degrees Farenheight",,,,,
"textbf{(2)} Looking closer at our response variable, `death`, we can see that the range of values is quite large, from 69 to 411 non-accidental deaths for different observations",,,,,
The median number of non-accidental deaths was 114 in this dataset,,,,,
"When we log-transform the varaible, the range is now from 4.234 to 6.019, with a median of 4.736",,,,,
"In Figure 2, we see the histogram for the log of `death`, which appears to have a similar shape to the original variable, unimodel and fairly symmetrical with outliers",,,,,
"Next, we can examine how each variable relates to one another",,,,,
"textbf{(4)} In Figure 3, we see that are high correlations between a number of our variables of interest",,,,,
"Notably, there is positive correlation between `o3median` and `tmpd` with correlation coefficient 0.542",,,,,
"Similarly, there is a positive correlation between `pm10median` and `tmpd`, with coefficient 0.359",,,,,
"Other significant correlations include a negative correlation between `log_death` and `tmpd` with coefficient -0.401, and a positive correlation between two of the pollutant variables, `pm10median` and `so2median`",,,,,
"Interestingly, we can see a sinusoidal relationship between the `pm10median` variable and the `date`, as it seems that it may fluctuate for certain seasons, but the correlation between the variables appears to be relatively low, -.165",,,,,
"We are also interested in seeing if the effect of pollution is instantaneous, so we look at the relationship of the lagged, or 7 day averages, of the original variables, as shown in Figure 4",,,,,
We can see that each respective correlation coefficient has gotten stronger for the lag version of the variables,,,,,
"Between our response variable, `log_death` and each of the lag variables, the correlation coefficients have increased",,,,,
"For `log_death` and `lag_pm10median`, `lag_o3median`, `lag_so2median`, and `lag_tmpd`, the coefficients are -0.164, -0.285, 0.137, -0.475, each more extreme than -0.015, -0.192, 0.099, -0.401, the correlation coefficients when using the daily version of the variables",,,,,
This increase may suggest that the effect of pollution actually extends over time,,,,,
"Looking closer at the relationship between the deaths and time, we can see that it appears to fluctuate sinusoidally depending on the time of year, shown in Figure 5",,,,,
"Further, there is a spike with many outliers between 1995 and 1996",,,,,
This spike was due to a heat wave that took place in the summer or 1995 that killed an large number of people in Chicago,,,,,
"For our modeling, however, we can keep these events since the observations include the temperature, which is the main factor in the spike of deaths",,,,,
"textbf{(5)} By including the `lag_tmpd` or `tmpd` variable in the model, which seems to be a good decision due to the strong correlation we found it to have with deaths",,,,,
We would need to account for this relationship to control for its effect on the death rate when exploring the effect of pollutants,,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,
"To model the data, we will use two Poisson generalized additive models, one using the covariates that are not lagged, and one with the lagged versions of the covariates, with the 7-day averages of each measurement",,,,,
"textbf{(1)} For the non-lagged, we call Model 1, we will use a Poisson generalized additive model with a log link, with covariates `pm10median`, `o3median`, `so2median`, `tmpd`, each with a spline smoother with 4 degrees of freedom predicting our response, `death`",,,,,
"Similarly, for the lagged, Model 2, we use the same type of model but with covariates `lag_pm10median`, `lag_o3median`, `lag_so2median`, and `lag_tmpd`",,,,,
"We have chosen to include `tmpd` as a covariate based on our EDA, since it appears to have a strong relationship that must be accounted for with `death`",,,,,
"To determine the performance and how well each model fits the data, we will use 5-fold cross validation",,,,,
"We will randomly sample the folds from the original data into a test and train set, and use the same folds for each model",,,,,
"textbf{(2)} In the table below, the cross validation errors and standard errors of the estimates are displayed for Models 1 and 2",,,,,
"begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} hline & Model 1 & Model 2  hline Cross validation error & 200.878 & 187.4731  hline Estimated standard error & 22.51874 & 22.07823  hline end{tabular} We can see that the cross validation error of Model 2, is lower than that of Model 1",,,,,
"textbf{(3)} However, compared to the estimated standard errors, the difference in the cross validation errors is not extremely significant, with that of Model 2 being slightly lower",,,,,
"Furthermore, the estimated standard errors of the MSEs are very similar and small compared to the cross validation errors, meaning that our estimates for the cross validation errors are equally valid",,,,,
"Comparing the two models, though, they have the same complexity and only differ in terms of the version of covariates used",,,,,
Each of these terms utilizes the same smoothing spline for each term with the same number of degrees of freedom,,,,,
"Thus, we will opt to use Model 2 since the prediction error is lower",,,,,
Results,,,,,
"Using our GAM model with the lagged terms, we want to see how well the model fits in general",,,,,
"To do so, we will conduct a global goodness of fit test using a Chi square distribution with the deviance of the model and the degrees of freedom",,,,,
"textbf{(1)} From our test, we get a p-value of 0 using a Chi square test",,,,,
"This p-value implies that our model does not fit very well to the data, and we would reject our model for a saturated model instead",,,,,
"textbf{(2)} To further explore this relationship, we fit a simpler model with just the temperature, or `lag_tmpd` as a covariate",,,,,
We use the lagged version of the temperature for consistency with our chosen model,,,,,
"From an ANOVA Chi squared test between the simple model with just temperature and Model 2, we get a deviance of 247.56 with p-value of 2.2e-16",,,,,
"This p-value is much smaller than an alpha level 0.05, meaning that the added terms for pollutants do seem to contribute to the model for predicting deaths",,,,,
"Thus, it seems that pollutants do contribute to mortality",,,,,
"Going back to one our original research questions, whether the effect of pollution is instaneous or extends over time, we can use our results from the cross-validation we did for Models 1 and 2",,,,,
"textbf{(3)} Since Model 2, the one with the lagged versions of the 7 day averages of the pollutants as the covariates, performed better with a lower cross-validation error, it appears that the effect of pollution extends over time",,,,,
"In other words, the level of pollutants would affect the death rate over time instead of immediately",,,,,
"In Figure 6, the relationships between each covariate and the outcome is displayed",,,,,
"Note that the uncertainty for the covariates the particulate matter, ozone, and sulfur dioxide seem to be much higher than that of the temperature variable",,,,,
This seems to imply that the association between temperature and the deaths is the strongest,,,,,
The uncertainty for `lag_o3median` also appears to be less wide than the other two pollutant variables,,,,,
"Consequently, it seems that these two covariates have the strongest association with the outcome, the number of deaths, since the outcome varies the most for different values of these covariates",,,,,
"The effect of sulfur dioxide does not seem to be as significant since the curve is flatter than others, and the parts where there is variation come with a great amount of uncertainty",,,,,
"textbf{(4)} Circling back to one of the original research questions proposed, we will use our model to predict the number of deaths for a 70 degree day with the lowest observed levels of each (7 day average) pollutant",,,,,
"For this dataset, the lowest median level of particulate matter was -24.12 milligrams per cubic meter, concentration of ozone was -18.924 parts per billion, and concentration of sulfur dioxide was -4.643 parts per billion",,,,,
The model estimates 107.9548 non-accidental deaths for this theoretical observation,,,,,
"Our 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [105.3051, 110.6711]",,,,,
"In order to see the validity of our interval, we utilize parametric bootstrapping to generate new data and construct a new confidence interval",,,,,
"Based on our plot in Figure 7, we can see that the death variable follows a Poisson distribution well, meaning that we trust the model that we are using since it assumes that distribution",,,,,
"Thus, we can use a parametric bootstrap to generate new data and construct our pivotal confidence interval",,,,,
"In the table below, we display the pivotal confidence interval that we have generated as a result of our bootstrapping textbf{(6)}, as well as the original confidence interval",,,,,
"begin{tabular}{|c|c|} hline Predict Function Confidence Interval & Pivotal Bootstrap Confidence Interval  hline [105.3051, 110.6711] & [104.9182, 110.862]  hline end{tabular} textbf{(7)} Comparing these two intervals, we can see that the one from the bootstrap is slightly wider, but very similar to that of the predict function",,,,,
This similarity means that our assumption about the distribution of the data being Poisson is likely to be correct,,,,,
"Combining our results, we are confident that our true estimate of non-accidental deaths for a 70-degree day is between 105 and 110",,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,
"In this study, we investigated two different generalized additive models using a Poisson with a log link",,,,,
"The first model used the raw observations for each pollutant and temperature covariate, while the second used the lagged versions",,,,,
"textbf{(1)} By comparing the performance of these two models, we were able to discover that the effects of pollutants on mortality seem to extend over time rather than being instaneous",,,,,
"Furthermore, we can see that pollutants do indeed have an affect on mortality",,,,,
"More specifically, ozone seems to have the highest association among the three pollutants studied",,,,,
"As the ozone cocentration increases, so does mortality",,,,,
"Similarly, an increase in particulate matter seems to be associated with an increase in mortality",,,,,
"textbf{(2)} Though we found that certain pollutants are associated with an increase in mortality, we cannot conclude a causal effect between reducing pollutants and decreasing mortality",,,,,
The model was based on association between these variables and the dataset we used was observational,,,,,
"Thus, since effects were not assigned randomly, Preston Jorgensen can only conclude associative effects",,,,,
"textbf{(3)} Although we chose to use smoothing splines for each covariate in our original models, a simple plot of each of the terms shows that some of the terms might have been linear and did not require a smoothing spline",,,,,
"The smoothing adds complexity to the model, and terms like `lag_tmpd` and `lag_so2median` appear to have a linear effect on the outcome",,,,,
This might mean to eliminating that complexity would lead to a better model fit,,,,,
Another possible impact to our conclusions was the inital data cleaning that was done to remove rows with any missing column values (NAs),,,,,
"This removal eliminated around 20% of the data, which might have biased our results to those observations without missing columns, especially if the levels of pollutants were related to the missing data",,,,,
