Introduction,,,,,
"Following our prior study on immortality, we will further explore this domain by looking into the relationship between air pollution and mortality",,,,,
"(1) The objective of this study is to determine which pollutants are most strongly associated with increased deaths, if they exist, and whether it's reasonable for Mr",,,,,
Jorgensen to fund research to reduce the level of these pollutants in his environment,,,,,
"We will be answering the following questions: (1) Is there evidence that the pollutants we mention in our analysis are associated with increased mortality, and which one is most strongly associated with mortality, (2) Is the effect of pollution on death rate instantaneous or does it extend over time, and (3) What is the mean death rate for Chicago on a typical 70-degree day if we lowered the level of all pollutants to match the lowest value ever recorded for those pollutants",,,,,
"(2) To answer our research questions, we will be utilizing the `chicago.csv` dataset, which contains daily measurements of air quality, total number of non-accidental deaths, and mean temperature in Chicago, IL from January 1987 to December 2000",,,,,
The dataset contains 5114 daily observations of six variables,,,,,
"The six variables measure the number of days before/after Dec 31, 1993, number of non-accidental deaths, median density of small particulate matter (air pollution), median concentration of ozone, median concentration of sulfur dioxide, and the mean temperature in Fahrenheit",,,,,
There are also four additional variables that measure the 7-day averages of the temperature and three pollutant variables,,,,,
"With this data, we will be developing complex models analyzing the association between deaths and various pollutants",,,,,
"(3) The results of our research indicate that out of all pollutants, ozone and mortality have the strongest association, followed by particulate matter",,,,,
"These associations are non-linear, indicating that a change in levels of these pollutants wouldn't be proportional to a change in non-accidental deaths on a particular day",,,,,
"The influence of these pollutants on mortality appears to extend over time, rather than act instantaneously",,,,,
"However, due to limitations in our current data, we cannot conclude that high pollutant levels ""cause"" deaths",,,,,
If Mr,,,,,
"Jorgensen pays for research to reduce the levels of $PM_{10}$, $O_3$, and $SO_2$ to the lowest they've been historically, he can reasonably expect the number of non-accidental deaths to be approximately 109 deaths or within 106 to 112 deaths",,,,,
"Due to the potential existence of hidden variables that can influence non-accidental deaths and lack of insight on the association between temperature and the pollutants, we believe there's insufficient evidence to convince Mr",,,,,
Jorgensen to pay for air quality treatments in his environment to reduce mortality,,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,
"Before we start developing models, this section will provide insight on the key variables we will be examining in this paper",,,,,
"We will first conduct univariate analysis on the following eight covariates: $PM_{10}$ (median density of particulate matter), $O_3$ (median concentration of ozone in parts per billion), $SO_2$ (median concentration of sulfur dioxide), `temperature` (mean temperature in F), and $lagPM_{10}$, $lagO_3$, $lagSO_2$, and `lag_temperature`, which are the 7-day averages of the first four variables",,,,,
"We're including the lag variables in our analysis to explore the possibility of deaths being related to the amount of pollution over several days, rather than a single day alone",,,,,
"While we will also use `time` (number of days before/after Dec 31, 1993) in our analysis, it will serve as an index and doesn't require further analysis",,,,,
"(1) From Figure 1, we see the distribution of our non-lagged covariates ($PM_{10}$, $O_3$, $SO_2$, and `temperature`)",,,,,
"The distribution of covariates measuring air quality $PM_{10}$, $O_3$, and $SO_2$ are all right-skewed, while the covariate measuring `temperature` is slightly left-skewed",,,,,
The lagged covariates follow the same distribution as their respective original variables (not pictured),,,,,
There appears to be an unusually large outlier of 320.7 parts/billion for the variable $PM_{10}$ when considering the mean $PM_{10}$ value is only -0.27 parts/billion,,,,,
"None of the variables, including `death`, in the dataset seem to explain this value, nor is there any unusual environmental event on the date this occurred, May 7, 1988",,,,,
"As a result, we will remove this outlier to avoid bias in our regression fit",,,,,
We also note the presence of multiple NAs in $PM_{10}$ and all of our lagged variables,,,,,
"Since removing observations with NAs would still leave us with a substantially large dataset (4011 observations), we will do EDA and model selection with the reduced dataset (days with complete data)",,,,,
The above variables are the covariates in our research,,,,,
"Now, we will look into our response variable, `death` (number of non-accidental deaths on a particular day)",,,,,
"Considering that `death` is a count variable and our covariates don't appear to have a linear relationship with deaths, which we will cover further in this paper, it's most logical to use Poisson GAMs with the log link function for our dataset",,,,,
"Therefore, we will look at `log(death)` instead of `death` in this univariate analysis",,,,,
"(2) In Figure 2, the distribution of `log(death)` appears to be normal",,,,,
"As quantitative proof, the mean of `log(death)`, 4.736 deaths, is equal to its median",,,,,
"While there are some large outliers, they're not significant enough to create a skew",,,,,
"Before conducting multivariate analysis, it's important to analyze our response variable, `death`, over time to determine if any historical events may have led to unexpected outliers",,,,,
Figure 3 is a scatterplot depicting the number of non-accidental deaths over the time period this dataset records,,,,,
We note that there are a series of large outliers in `death` right after the year 1995,,,,,
"Upon closer inspection, the unusually high deaths occurred between July 13, 1995 and July 16, 1995",,,,,
"This was when Chicago's deadliest heat wave occurred, where temperatures reached up to 106 degrees Fahrenheit (weather.gov)",,,,,
"In our dataset, the unusually high deaths on these four days don't seem to be explained well by the temperatures recorded on those days",,,,,
"The corresponding `temperature` values for these dates were 91.5 degrees F, 86.0 degrees F, 83.0 degrees F, and 78.5 degrees F, which aren't even the highest temperature values in this dataset",,,,,
"This means that the highest deaths aren't paired with disproportionately high temperatures, which was the primary contributor to the deaths in real life",,,,,
"Since this misalignment can bias the regression, we will proceed with removing the four observations recorded during Chicago's heat wave",,,,,
"Now, we can conduct multivariate analysis on our dataset",,,,,
"From the correlation plots in Figure 4, we can determine the correlations between our covariates and our non-lagged response variables",,,,,
"(3) Overall, we only have evidence to reasonably conclude $O_3$, $SO_2$, and `temperature` may have a non-zero association with `death`",,,,,
"The plot suggests that $O_3$ and `death`, and `temperature` and `death` are negatively correlated, while $SO_2$ and `death` are positively correlated",,,,,
"The association between `temperature` and `death` seems to be the strongest, with the association between `death` and $O_3$ being the strongest pollutant-mortality association",,,,,
"The predictor variables appear to have significant non-zero correlations with each other, with the positive association between `temperature` and $O_3$ being the largest, followed by the positive association between $SO_2$ and $PM_{10}$",,,,,
"Since we're also planning on exploring the association between death and air quality/temperature metrics across multiple days, we will create a correlation matrix with our lagged covariates and our response variable, `death`",,,,,
A key difference in this correlation plot (Figure 5) compared to Figure 4 with non-lagged variables is that the correlations between all lagged covariates and the response are significant and stronger,,,,,
"Logically, this makes sense because the impact of air quality and unusual temperatures can compound on the human body as it prolongs",,,,,
(4) This revelation is useful as we explore the association between mortality and air quality because it shows that a change in levels for a pollutant can potentially have a stronger impact on death if it's consistent over multiple days,,,,,
Figure 5 also shows strong correlations above 0.5 between $PM_{10}$ and $O_3$ and temperature,,,,,
We further explore this by creating a scatterplot of these two pollutants versus temperature in Figure 6,,,,,
"(5) Notably, the presence of ozone and particulate matter pollutants appears to be stronger in higher temperatures, indicating that these pollutants are likely to be in higher concentrations during warmer temperatures, such as in the summer",,,,,
"Meanwhile, temperature and pollutants appear to have a mostly negative correlation with `death`, with the exception of $SO_2$",,,,,
"This is interesting to note because (1) it appears to contradict our initial assumption that higher temperatures and concentrations of pollutants are associated with high deaths and (2) there may exist a hidden variable that ""explains"" the strong positive correlation between temperature and pollutants",,,,,
"Overall, this brief analysis indicates that these relationships between covariates and our response may not necessarily be linear and the correlation between temperature and pollutants can potentially create bias in our analysis",,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,
"We will first construct two Poisson generalized additive models (GAMs), with the log-link function implemented on our response variable, `death`",,,,,
The first model will use the non-lagged covariates to determine the possibility of non-accidental deaths being related to air quality and temperature over a single day,,,,,
The second model will use the corresponding lagged covariates to determine the possibility of non-accidental deaths being related to air quality and temperature over multiple days,,,,,
"Both models have 4 degrees of freedom for all spline terms, which will be indicated as s()",,,,,
The two models are as follows: (1) Non-lagged GAM: Death ~ $beta_0$ + s($PM_{10}$) + s($O_3$) + s($SO_2$) + s(`temperature`)  Lagged GAM: Death ~ $beta_0$ + s($lagPM_{10}$) + s($lagO_3$) + s($lagSO_2$) + s(`lag_temperature`) The reason why we used these complex models rather than a linear model is due to the increased flexibility we get from not assuming the relationships between our predictors and the response (`death`) are linear,,,,,
"From our EDA, we saw that the relationships between our predictors and response don't appear to be linear, thereby making GAMs more ideal for our analysis",,,,,
Figure 7 is a plot showing our two models (lagged GAM in blue and non-lagged GAM in red) overlayed on a scatterplot of our response variable `death` over time,,,,,
We can see that both models appear to accurately follow the general pattern of deaths over time,,,,,
"However, the blue line (lagged GAM) seems to better fit the peaks of `death` than the non-lagged GAM",,,,,
We can reasonably hypothesize from this plot that the lagged GAM appears to fit the data better than the non-lagged GAM,,,,,
"For a more formal analysis on which model fits the data better, we will conduct a 5-fold cross-validation to determine which of our two models fits best to the data in terms of prediction error",,,,,
"(2) Below is a table with the results of our cross-validation: begin{table}[ht] centering begin{tabular}{rrrr} hline & Model & PredictionError & StandardError  hline & No Lag GAM & 163.330 & 3.173  & Lagged GAM & 151.675 & 2.553  hline end{tabular} end{table} Based on the results of the 5-fold cross-validation, the GAM with lagged covariates has a lower prediction error than the GAM with non-lagged covariates, with a difference of 11.58",,,,,
"The lagged GAM also has a lower standard error than the non-lagged GAM, with a difference of 0.652",,,,,
"(3) To determine if these differences between the models are significant, we recorded prediction and standard errors from running 5-fold cross validation multiple times (not shown in paper)",,,,,
"The difference in prediction error between the models seemed to be significant since the lagged GAM consistently had the lowest prediction error in all trials, but the difference in standard error seemed to not be significant since the lagged GAM sometimes had a higher standard error than the non-lagged GAM in some trials",,,,,
"Since the difference in standard error between both models is not significant, we decide to use prediction error alone to conclude that the lagged GAM appears to be the best fit for the data and will be most ideal to use for our results",,,,,
"In other words, the model where mortality is related to pollutants and temperature over time appears to fit the data better than the model where mortality is related to pollutants and temperature over a single day",,,,,
Results,,,,,
"As we proceed with our lagged GAM, we want to further evaluate how well our model fits our data, and if another model may be better in comparison",,,,,
"To do so, we will conduct a global goodness-of-fit test on our lagged GAM",,,,,
"To do so, we will be comparing our lagged GAM with a saturated model",,,,,
"In our case, the saturated model would be the following Poisson generalized linear model: Death ~ $beta_0$ + $PM_{10}$ + $O_3$ + $SO_2$ + `temperature`",,,,,
"The degrees of freedom of this model is 4007, which is the number of observations in our dataset",,,,,
This indicates that the number of parameters in the saturated model is equal to the size of the dataset,,,,,
(1) Running an ANOVA test on these two models gives us a p-value of 3.41e-16,,,,,
This indicates that there's significant evidence to conclude that the difference in deviance between both models (approximately 112.9 higher for the saturated model) is non-zero,,,,,
This indicates that our model fits the data better than the saturated model due to its lower deviance,,,,,
"Next, we want to formally test whether the pollutants alone are associated with mortality",,,,,
"Our model so far also considers `lag_temperature` as a covariate, which means the impact of temperature is factored into our lagged GAM",,,,,
"To determine the significance of the association between pollutants and mortality alone, we will create a lagged GAM that only uses temperature as a feature, not the pollutants",,,,,
The new model is as follows: Death ~ $beta_0$ + s(`lag_temperature`),,,,,
"Running an ANOVA test on these two models, with the new model being the ""reduced"" model, shows that the reduced model with temperature as the only feature has a deviance that's 94.369 higher than our full model with both pollutants and temperature as features",,,,,
We then look at the p-value of the test to determine if this difference is significant,,,,,
"(2) Under $alpha=0.05$ significance level, our p-value of 7.00e-15 indicates we have significant evidence to assume the deviance is non-zero, which means we can ""reject"" our reduced model",,,,,
"In other words, there's significant evidence to conclude pollutants are associated with mortality",,,,,
"(3) As mentioned before, the effect of pollution appears to extend over time, as seen by our proof of our lagged GAM performing better than our non-lagged GAM",,,,,
"In the ""Modeling"" section, we noted that the lagged GAM had a lower prediction error and standard error than the non-lagged GAM after running 5-fold cross-validation",,,,,
"To further explore this, we also noted down the deviances of our lagged and non-lagged GAMs",,,,,
"The lagged GAM had a deviance of 5208.5, while the non-lagged GAM had a deviance of 5604.2",,,,,
This large difference in deviance of 395.7 serves as further proof that our lagged GAM appears to fit the data better and shows that the effect of pollution appears to extend over time,,,,,
"With this in mind, we will look into each pollutant in more detail and determine the pollutant that appears to be most associated with mortality",,,,,
"Figure 8 contains plots depicting the relationship between each lagged variable in our model and the outcome, `death`, with the dashed lines representing uncertainty",,,,,
We can also look at the distribution of points shown as rug marks along the x-axis of each plot,,,,,
"We clearly see a strong negative association between death and temperature, similar to what we noted in the EDA",,,,,
All three pollutant plots are more difficult to interpret due to sparse data possibly causing curvature on the ends,,,,,
This means potentially extreme data can display curvature that may not be existent in reality,,,,,
"Therefore, we looked at the level of uncertainty of each plot as well to determine which relationship between pollutant and mortality is strongest and with the least uncertainty",,,,,
"(4) $O_3$ appears to be most strongly associated with mortality due to there being less uncertainty in the relationship between $O_3$ and mortality for higher values of $O_3$, which means the curvature is likely to be part of the true fit",,,,,
"$PM_{10}$ appears to have the next strongest association with mortality due to more data points existing at the upper end of its plot to ""explain"" the curvature compared to $SO_2$",,,,,
"This aligns with our initial EDA analysis where we hypothesized that $O_3$ appears to have the strongest association with mortality, followed by $PM_{10}$ and $SO_2$",,,,,
"Now, we can answer our last research question: What is the mean death rate for Chicago on a typical 70-degree day if we lowered the level of all pollutants to match the lowest value ever recorded for those pollutants",,,,,
This can help Mr,,,,,
Jorgensen have an idea of the mean mortality on a typical 70-degree day given the 7-day average of pollutants are minimized to the lowest levels recorded in the dataset,,,,,
"For reference, the concentration of pollutants we will use for this prediction are as follows: -24.12 mg/cubic m for $PM_{10}$, -18.92 parts/billion average for $O_3$ and -4.64 parts/billion for $SO_2$",,,,,
"(5) Using our lagged GAM, the 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths given these pollution levels on a 70-degree day is: [105.69, 112.44] deaths, or approximately between 106 and 112 deaths",,,,,
The point estimate of the mean number of deaths on this day would be 109,,,,,
"This confidence interval was created using the `predict` function on R, which means there is an underlying assumption that our model is ""correct""",,,,,
"Because using the `predict` function relies on such a key assumption that we can't guarantee is held, we will create a pivotal confidence interval with a bootstrap, which typically has less strict assumptions",,,,,
"Our three options are: parametric bootstrap, resampling residuals, and resampling by cases",,,,,
"While we have confidence in our lagged GAM being a good fit for the model due to the flexibility from fitting splines for each variable, the plots from Figure 7 show high curvature towards the ends due to less data being available with higher levels of pollutants or temperatures",,,,,
"If more data was available and the data indicated that there's less curvature on these ends in reality, our current model isn't guaranteed to be ""correct"", which would break the assumption for the parametric bootstrap",,,,,
"Because we have minimal information about the residuals of our model and a narrow confidence interval isn't required for our study, we will choose the ""resampling by cases"" bootstrap method with 1000 bootstrap iterations",,,,,
"A resampling by cases bootstrap assumes nothing about the distribution of the data or its noise, making it the most conservative approach to determining a confidence interval based on the dataset alone",,,,,
"(6) Our 95% pivotal confidence interval for the mean number of deaths ends up being: [104.20, 113.34] deaths, or approximately 104 to 113 deaths",,,,,
"(7) We note that our bootstrap confidence interval is wider than the interval we generated from using R's built-in `predict` function, [105.69, 112.44]",,,,,
"This is because the resampling cases bootstrap assumes nothing about the distribution of the data or its noise, thereby giving less precise and looser bounds for the confidence interval",,,,,
"Meanwhile, `predict` assumes the model is correct since it invokes methods that depends on the `class` of the object we input, a GAM",,,,,
"Therefore, we got a narrower confidence interval",,,,,
"However, the difference is only +/- 1 death, which is negligible",,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,
"In our research, we utilized a Poisson generalized additive model with the lagged (7-day average) variables of `temperature`, $PM_{10}$, $O_3$, and $SO_3$ to explore the association between atmospheric pollutants and mortality (count of non-accidental deaths)",,,,,
"(1) Our results indicated an association exists between pollutants and mortality, with $O_3$ appearing to have the strongest association with `death`, followed by $PM_{10}$",,,,,
"Because these relationships between pollutants and mortality appear to be non-linear, particularly for $O_3$, we can't directly state that increasing a pollutant by a unit is proportionally associated with an increase in mortality",,,,,
"We determined that the effect of pollution appears to extend over time because we had plausible evidence to conclude that our lagged GAM fit our data better than the non-lagged GAM, indicating that the 7-day averages of atmospheric pollution had a stronger association with `death` than single day observations",,,,,
"Logically, this makes sense since the negative effects of pollution tend to manifest after continued exposure",,,,,
"However, we did not prove causation, i.e",,,,,
"high or low concentrations of pollutants in a day ""cause"" a certain number of deaths",,,,,
"This is because we used observational data, while causal analysis typically requires controlled experiments",,,,,
"(2) Therefore, we believe that Preston Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the 7-day averages of pollutants to historically low levels would cause mortality to decrease to the point estimate we predicted, 109 deaths",,,,,
"While it's plausible to believe the number of non-accidental deaths would fall in the range of 106 to 112 deaths on a 70-degree day, various external factors out of our control influence mortality as well, such as sociopolitical events or even personal health",,,,,
We conclude that it's not reasonable for Mr,,,,,
Jorgensen to fund research to reduce the level of pollutants in his environment because pollution treatments can be expensive and nearly impossible to maintain over time,,,,,
"(3) Looking ahead, we will cover two limitations to our analysis: (1) Outdated dataset and (2) Not accounting for the multicollinearity between `temperature` and the air pollutants in our lagged GAM model",,,,,
"For (1), the dataset we used for our research is over two decades old",,,,,
"Considering the rapid changes our environment and atmosphere have gone through due to rapid industrialization and globalization, we can assume that the observed concentrations of pollutants in the atmosphere and mortality back then may not be similar to what they are now",,,,,
Having observational data from the past decade instead can add more validity to our models and the conclusions we derive,,,,,
"For (2), we noted in the EDA section that `temperature` appears to be strongly correlated with $PM_{10}$ and $O_3$",,,,,
"This prompts research into the possible presence of a hidden variable that could ""explain"" this correlation",,,,,
"Since we didn't account for hidden variables, our analysis could potentially be biased if the hidden variable exists",,,,,
These limitations can be resolved by collecting air pollution data of Chicago from more recent years and also researching into the existence of a third variable exists that explains the association between `temperature` and pollutants,,,,,
