Introduction,,,,,
"(1) We are interested in studying the relationships between levels of pollution and how it affects mortality in Chicago, IL, and whether or not this relationship is instantaneous or time lagged",,,,,
"(2) Using 5144 observations of data from the CDC, we modeled the number of expected deaths per day using measurements of PM10, ozone, sulfur dioxide and temperature over time",,,,,
(3) We were able to conclude that weekly average measurements of our variables have a greater association with expected deaths per day than instantaneous measurements for any given day,,,,,
"This indicates that pollution affects deaths per day beyond the days they are observed, but within the same week",,,,,
"Our best model is a Poission GAM model with a log-link using only the lagged averaged variables as predictors, as well as time",,,,,
We were able to estimate a general expected death toll for any particular day being 114 to about 115 people with 95% confidence,,,,,
"Using our model, we also predicted with 95% confidence that if average weekly pollutants are at their lowest for a summer day, we expect only about 100 to 108 people to die",,,,,
"We are therefore able to infer that lower measurements of pollution are associated with lower mortality in Chicago, but recommend further investigation into this relationship independent of the given seasons",,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,
Data Description,,,,,
"Our data is from CDC measurements of different types of pollution and temperature in Chicago, IL",,,,,
The date is also recorded,,,,,
"In addition, weekly average values for each variable are also given as ""lag-variables""",,,,,
A lag-variable observation is the average of observations 6 days prior and including the day (an average of 7 days),,,,,
"There are 5,114 observations of the variables below: death (response) - The number of non-accidental deaths on that date time - The date of observation, given as the number of days before or after December 31, 1993 pm10median - The median density of PM10 pollution",,,,,
"This is particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers (milligrams per cubic meter), such as soot from fires, sea salt from the ocean, or mineral dust from mining and construction",,,,,
o3median - The median concentration of ozone (parts per billion),,,,,
"The ozone layer high in the stratosphere absorbs most ultraviolet light from the Sun, but ozone at ground level is dangerous",,,,,
"so2median - The median concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2), which is produced as a byproduct of combustion, such as by burning coal, sulfur dioxide is both toxic and a contributor to acid rain",,,,,
tmpd - The mean temperature (Fahrenheit) Each of the variables has a lag-variable counterpart except for time and death,,,,,
Univariate Analysis,,,,,
### Potential Predictors (1) The following plots in figure 1 show the distributions of all of our potential predictors,,,,,
"The left column shows the distribution of our variables measured on any particular day, while the right column shows the distribution of our variables measured as 7-day averages, wherein the observation represents the average measurements of the prior week",,,,,
"The weekly averaged variables are short hand called ""lag-variables"", indicating the measurements represent lagged time effects over the span of a week",,,,,
"From figure 1, we observe that our pollution variables, original and lagged, have longer right tails than left tails",,,,,
"This indicates that they are not normally distributed, despite both PM10 and sulfur dioxide both being unimodal",,,,,
"This is further indicated since in all of these plots, the means of our variables (blue dashed line) are all greater than their medians (orange dashed line), representing the long right tails' influence on these measurements",,,,,
"While this is also the case with ozone pollution, we also note this distribution has a very wide range of common values, and its lag-variable shows a bimodal distribution with peaks, from largest to second largest, respectively, around -10 and 1",,,,,
"As for our temperature variable, we see a bimodal distribution in both our original and lag variables with peaks, from largest to second largest, respectively, around 69 and 37 degrees fahrenheit",,,,,
"For both distributions, the left tail is longer than the right, but the most frequent range of temperature is for warmer days, while colder days span a larger range",,,,,
This is why we see that the mean in these plots is slightly lower than the median,,,,,
"We do not need these plots to understand that Chicago experiences seasons that result in varying temperatures, but understanding aspects the weather may help us further understand pollution's affect on residents of Chicago",,,,,
"### Response (2) Figure 2 below plots the distribution of our desired response variable, the number of deaths per day in Chicago",,,,,
"We suspect a Poisson General Additive Model would be appropriate to investigate the relationship between pollution and deaths in Chicago, wherein our response is assumed to have a Poisson distribution modeled with a log-link function",,,,,
"Since we model the log of our response, figure 2 below shows both the original distribution of our response, death, and the distribution on the log scale",,,,,
We will use the log-transformed death variable for the rest of our analysis,,,,,
The original distribution of deaths per day plotted above is unimodal and visually symmetric about its mean of approximately 115,,,,,
"The overlaid density curve shows a long right tail, and this is due to a number of potential outliers",,,,,
This is what is causing the median (orange dashed line) to deviate left very slightly from the mean (blue dashed line),,,,,
"We see the same distribution shape on the log scale, but with a shorter right tail due to the log-scaling of the outliers",,,,,
We will investigate these potential outliers further in the next section,,,,,
Bivariate Analysis,,,,,
"### Potential Predictors by Day (3) Figure 3 below shows all the relationships between our original potential predictors which are measured daily, as well as our our response, log-death",,,,,
"It appears that log-death is most associated with temperature, wherein there is a mild, negative association that suggests deaths increase with lower temperatures",,,,,
"The pollution variables do not have a clear relationship with our response, but it seems that ozone may also have a negative relationship with log-death",,,,,
"Looking closer, we see that ozone is associated with temperature, and past about 55 degrees fahrenheit, ozone consistently increases",,,,,
The potential association ozone shows with log-death may be a result of log-death's relationship with temperature and temperature's relationship with ozone,,,,,
Note that we can see there are many potential outliers in our response variable,,,,,
These will be addressed later,,,,,
"Looking solely at our predictors, we see that some of them may be associated with each other",,,,,
"Temperature seems to have a positive relationship with ozone, but shows no clear relationships with sulfur dioxide or PM10 pollution",,,,,
"Sulfur dioxide and PM10, however, show a somewhat positive association that increases in variance with increased values of both variables",,,,,
"The same can be said with ozone and PM10, but the relationship is less clear than the latter",,,,,
"To understand the structure of these relationships and how they influence our results, we will need to rely most heavily on their contributions and interactions in our potential models",,,,,
"### Potential Predictors by Week (lag-variables) (3) Since we are also interested in determining whether or not our predictors are most influential to deaths over short spans of time instead on any given particular day, we will look at our lag-variables separately from our original variables",,,,,
We can confidently state that the original variables and their respective lag-variables are heavily correlated with each other,,,,,
Figure 4 shows the bivariate relationships between these lag-variables and our log-response,,,,,
"The relationships are logically very similar to those seen with our original variables in the previous section, but the range of each individual predictor is less varied since each observation is an average",,,,,
This makes viewing the relationships more clear as opposed to the original variables,,,,,
"Firstly, we see in figure 4 that log-death still does not seem to be directly related to any particular measurement of pollution, but maintains its negative association with temperature",,,,,
"Temperature's positive relationship with ozone is more clear, but it also seems to have a positive association with PM10, which was ambiguous previously",,,,,
"Other relationships that have become more clear are ozone and PM10 as well as sulfur dioxide and PM10, which both show a positive association",,,,,
"These lag-variables seem to be more clearly related to each other than the original variables appeared, but we can consider these associations to be true between both the original and lag sets of variables since they are derived from the same data",,,,,
"The decreased variation in these lag-variables indicate that they may be better for modeling than their original counterparts, and they also show clearer relationships (or lack there of) with our desired response, log-deaths",,,,,
newpage ### Time as a Predictor (3) One variable we mentioned in the data section but since paid very little attention to is time,,,,,
"To restate, our time variable gives the date of each observation for our predictors and response",,,,,
"We suspect that most of our variables are logically dependent on the time of year, such as temperature",,,,,
"It may also be the case that pollution may increase or decrease during a particular time of year due any patterns of emissions in Chicago, such as factory output, increased gas usage to heat houses in the winter, or perhaps increased car travel during the summer",,,,,
"We also know that the data spans every day for 13 years, which may impact these patterns with the passage of new laws, restrictions, or change in crime rates that can impact our desired response",,,,,
"Whatever the case may be, we investigate the dependency of our variables of interest with time below",,,,,
### Deaths by Time We first look at how our response changes over time,,,,,
"Since we will be using log-deaths in our model and want to determine if time should be a predictor, we will look at log-deaths over time",,,,,
"The relationship between our unscaled death variable and time is the same as with the log-scaled version, but using the log-scaled response is helpful in making modeling decisions",,,,,
"Figure 5 below shows log-deaths per day over our 13 year time period, staring with in the beginning 1987 and ending at the end of the year 2000",,,,,
This plot shows log-deaths as a time series with an overlaid 4-week moving average line,,,,,
"This line plots the average number of log-deaths over a 4 week period (one month), which allows us to more clearly see how the number of deaths changes over the years, in general",,,,,
This is helpful because the 4-week average line is more resistant to outliers than the raw time series,,,,,
(3) The time series plot shows a clear seasonal pattern in the number of deaths,,,,,
"Log-deaths is highest in the winter months and then decreases into the summer months, only to rise again back into winter",,,,,
"This cyclic pattern is very important, and changes how we view the distribution of deaths in Chicago",,,,,
This observation alone indicates that time should somehow be used as a predictor in our model,,,,,
"Since we do not see any evident changes over the years as a whole, we can separate our response by season into deaths in summer and deaths in winter",,,,,
"Based on a little research on Chicago's seasons, we classify summer as May-October and winter as November-April",,,,,
"An ANOVA F-test confirms that the sample populations of summer log-deaths are lower than winter log-deaths with a p-value of approximately 0 and an F-statistic of 989.6 (while removing outliers, discussed momentarily)",,,,,
"While we cannot definitively assume that the death variables by season are normally distributed, the log-transformation allows us to roughly assume normality and find a general 99.7% confidence bound based from winter deaths and summer deaths, shown as the orange and blue lines above",,,,,
"We expect that almost all of the data should fall within the plotted bounds, and if it does not, we suspect the observation is an outlier",,,,,
This is how we evaluated potential outliers,,,,,
"Since the distribution of deaths differs based on season, defining our response's confidence bounds by season is a cautious and conservative approach to diagnosing outliers",,,,,
"### A Note on Outliers in our Response Variable: Referencing figure 5, it is very clear that four observations fall far outside these bounds in the summer of 1995, with log-death values above 5.4",,,,,
"Other than these, only three observations fall slightly above our winter deaths upper bound with values below 5.25, and two below our summer death lower bound",,,,,
The observations are given below in table 1,,,,,
"To evaluate whether or not these values should be included in our data, we looked for events in Chicago on the respective dates that would allow us to classify these values as abnormal, and are not explained by our given predictors, pollution variables and temperature",,,,,
"What we found was that only the consecutive dates (07/13 - 07/16) in the summer of 1995, the most egregious instances of our potential outliers, had a record of abnormal circumstances",,,,,
There was a heat wave during this time that killed over 700 people over these 4 days,,,,,
"While we have the variable temperature that can help explain this situation, we believe these observations should be removed anyway",,,,,
"The reason is because the heat wave, while hot and potentially dangerous, was primarily due to societal-political issues",,,,,
"Most of the deaths were reported to be poor, elderly people who did not have or were unable to afford air conditioning, and did not open their windows due to living in high-crime areas",,,,,
"In addition, many areas of the city lost power entirely while the city officials did not announce warnings of the heat wave until the 3rd day",,,,,
"There are no other observations even close to such high death counts in any year of our data, regardless of the season",,,,,
"Since societal factors are primarily to blame for the number of deaths, we will not include these dates in our data",,,,,
"As for the other potential outliers, nothing particularly notable was able to be found about these dates, and while they may actually be outliers, our definition of such is rather unorthodox and their values are not high enough to be particularly influential like the summer heat wave in 1995",,,,,
"We therefore decide to leave these values in our data set as accounted for extremes, or perhaps, part of the 0.3% we did not include in our bounds",,,,,
"Moving forward, we will now only use data with the heat wave of 1995 outliers removed",,,,,

Results,,,,,
Goodness of Fit,,,,,
"Looking at our diagnostic goodness of fit plots in figure 9, we see that the distribution of residuals is approximately normal and has an even spread around 0, consistent with our assumptions",,,,,
This determines that the fit of our chosen model is relatively decent,,,,,
"In addition, our residual plots by predictor variable (not shown), also show decently adequate results that meet our necessary assumptions, in general",,,,,
"PM10 pollution shows some outliers, it appears, but this is consistent with its distribution",,,,,
Pollutants and Deaths in Chicago,,,,,
"(2) To determine if pollutants have an association with our response, log-deaths, we run an chi square deviance test on a reduced null model, including no pollutant variables, and our chosen lag-model from the previous section",,,,,
Please note that I included my time (month and year) variables in my null model as well because they are also included in my lag-model and leaving them out would not yield accurate results for this question,,,,,
"Our null model is regressed on the identical spline terms for lag-temperature, month and year used in our lag-model, described in the previous section",,,,,
The chi square deviance test shows that the full lag-model reduces the deviance by 18.86 and is statistically significant at the 99% confidence level with a p-value of 0.0086,,,,,
This shows that the lag-model's inclusion of the pollutant variables benefits its fit with deaths in Chicago,,,,,
We can conclude that the pollutant variables have an association with deaths in Chicago,,,,,
"(3) Moreover, since our lag-model yielded better performance results and diagnostics over our per-day model as seen in the previous Modeling & Diagnostics section, we can conclude that deaths in Chicago are more associated with pollutants over time than instantaneously from measurements per day",,,,,
Predictor Terms in our Resultant Model,,,,,
"(4) In figure 10 below, we plot all of our individual model terms, which are all splines, by their respective variable data",,,,,
"We can see that the average outcome of our spline terms are generally nonlinearly related to the data except for lag-temperature, which appears to be roughly linear with a negative relationship",,,,,
"It seems that the variables most associated with deaths in Chicago, our response variable being log-deaths, are month, year and temperature",,,,,
"These variables show clear relationships that are not close to being of slope zero, and have generally consistent and narrow error bounds that bolster our confidence in these relationships",,,,,
"Otherwise, lag-PM10 shows an approximately positive association, however, we lack data near the right tail, and this is the range (above about PM10 = 20) where the positive association is visually most drastic",,,,,
"Before PM10 = 20, we have more data and narrow error bounds, but the relationship levels off and appears closer to having a zero slope, indicating the association with log-deaths is not strong",,,,,
"For lag-ozone pollution, the association shows a similar issue with large error bounds at the tails, and particularly the right tail",,,,,
"In general, this is expected since we are aware that neither PM10 nor ozone pollution are normally distributed and both have longer right tails",,,,,
The concave up curvature of the lag-ozone term plot does not resemble the relationship seen by our lag-temperature term plot,,,,,
"This is interesting given the positive association we found between lag-ozone and lag-temperature, but this deviation from our previous intuition gives us confidence in lag-ozone's relationship with log-deaths, our response",,,,,
Prediction and Inference,,,,,
(5) We are interested in the expected number of deaths if pollution is at its lowest,,,,,
"Using the data seen by our chosen lag-model, we find that the lowest observed value for lag-PM10 pollution is -24.12 (scaled mg/m^3), and our lowest observed value for lag-ozone pollution is -18.9239 (scaled ppb)",,,,,
"While setting lag-temperature to 70 degrees fahrenheit, we also find when the average number of deaths (same for log-deaths) is lowest for both month and year given that it is summer (a likely case for a 70 degree day), which corresponds to August and the year 1998",,,,,
"Our model reports that we can expect about 104 (estimate = 103.91) people to die in Chicago, with a 95% confidence interval of (100.14, 107.67), or about 100 to 108 people",,,,,
"(6) We would like to determine if this estimate for the expected number of deaths in Chicago during the lowest pollution observations is any different from the expected number of deaths in general, according to our lag-model",,,,,
"To do this, we run a nonparametric bootstrap with 1000 iterations to estimate a 95% pivotal confidence interval for the expected number of deaths overall",,,,,
"We choose to use the nonparametric method because, as stated in the earlier Model Diagnostics sections, we lack confidence in our model assumptions, and would like to use a robust estimate to compensate",,,,,
"Our estimate for the expected number of deaths from our bootstrap is 114.52 (4.74 on the log-scale) or about 114 people, and has a 95% pivotal confidence interval of (114.08, 114.99), (4.737, 4.745) on the log-scale, or about (114, 115) people",,,,,
"(7) With this, we observe that our two confidence intervals for the expected number of deaths in Chicago, one predicted with the lowest observed pollution values and the other predicted generally, do not overlap and are entirely separate",,,,,
The closest bounds have about a 6 person difference between them,,,,,
"Since they do not overlap, we can infer that lower average pollutant measurements, for PM10 and ozone pollutants, likely result in lower deaths per day in Chicago",,,,,
This is a crucial statement when understanding how pollutants affect expected deaths,,,,,
"We must also acknowledge that our expected deaths predicted with our lowest observed pollution values takes place during a time when the temperature is 70 degrees, or likely during the summer months",,,,,
By comparing this estimate generally to a prediction of expected deaths over all our months may lead to potentially skewed results due to seasonally dependent relationships with our response,,,,,
"We maintain that lower observations of average pollutants likely lead to lower death counts in Chicago, however more analysis should be done to bolster this claim independent of the season",,,,,
This is difficult since our pollution variables tend to vary with time as well,,,,,
Conclusion,,,,,
Prediction and Inference,,,,,
"(1) In this report we were able to model the expected number of deaths in Chicago using variables measuring pollution, temperature and time",,,,,
We were able to conclude with relative confidence that the number of deaths on any given day in Chicago is most associated with pollution over short time periods (1 week) as opposed to pollutant measurements on any particular day,,,,,
"We also found that the lagged affect of pollution is quite clear and benefits our resultant model significantly when compared to a model that does not use pollution measurements as variables, and we can generally say that there is a positive association with increased measurements of pollution and deaths",,,,,
"The variables that are most associated with deaths in Chicago, however, appear to be time and temperature",,,,,
"The pollutants that are most associated with deaths in Chicago are weekly averages of PM10 and ozone pollution, and sulfur dioxide is not found to be associated with deaths at all",,,,,
"To test their expected affect on deaths, we were able to compare our predicted death toll from our model for values of lowest observed average pollution to the average expected death toll generally, and were able to conclude that low average pollution values lead to low expected death tolls in Chicago",,,,,
"(3) While this relationship is potentially skewed by the time of year, we maintain this claim and suggest more analysis should be run, holding time or seasonality constant",,,,,
"This is a limitation of our study, and perhaps another model method would be appropriate to allow the inclusion of interaction terms",,,,,
"(2) We cannot say, generally, that lowering pollutants would cause lower death tolls because the data is purely observational, meaning the relationships observed are only associations and we did not have complete control over the factors in this data",,,,,
