Introduction,,,,,
"We are looking at data to help you, Preston Jorgensen, research different ways that might extend your life(1)",,,,,
We have observed higher death rates in areas with higher levels of air pollution,,,,,
"Seeing this, we are interested in learning which pollutants have the strongest association with increased deaths(1)",,,,,
"On a deeper level, we want to know if there is evidence that these pollutants are associated with increased mortality and which one has the strongest association with mortality(1)",,,,,
We also want to know if the effect of pollution is instantaneous or if it extends over time(1),,,,,
"In simpler terms, does the pollution amount on a certain day affect the death rate only on that day or over time(1)",,,,,
Based on this information we’ll estimate the mean death rate given the level of each pollutant was lowered to match the lowest value ever recorded(1),,,,,
"Taking all of this information into account, we will make a recommendation as to whether or not you should spend your wealth in efforts to reduce pollution by that amount(1)",,,,,
Now we look at the actual data we are working with,,,,,
The data we have contains 6 variables with 5114 unique observations(2),,,,,
"The first variable, Time, refers to the date of observation as the number of days before or after December 31, 1993(2)",,,,,
This data will be converted into actual dates(2),,,,,
Death is a numerical quantity reporting how many non-accidental deaths occured on that date(2),,,,,
"The next variable, pm10median, is the median density of PM10 pollution (particulate matter with diameter less than 10 micrometers)(2)",,,,,
O3median is the median concentration of ozone measured in parts per billion(2),,,,,
"Similarly, so2median is the median concentration of sulfur dioxide (SO2)(2)",,,,,
The last variable is tmpd which is the mean temperature in Fahrenheit(2),,,,,
It is important to note that 7-day averages of the original variables are also given(2),,,,,
They are denoted with “lag” as a prefix,,,,,
"Using the data, we develop a model for the number of non-accidental deaths from the pollutants in the air and temperature, allowing us to understand its implications(3)",,,,,
"We explore this relationship and find that pollutants do have an association with the deaths, and ozone has theh strongest association(3)",,,,,
Deaths and quantity of pollutants in the air have a positive correlation through a Poisson generalized additive model(3),,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis ,,,,,
"Before we start modeling the data, it is important to analyze the variables we are working with",,,,,
The histograms in Figure 1 (4) help us with this,,,,,
We can see that we have data from the end of 1986 to the end of 2000,,,,,
Looking at pm10median’s histogram we can see it is unimodal with a right skewed shape(1),,,,,
"There are several outliers on the higher end seen in the boxplot (not displayed)(1).The same holds true for its 7 day average variable, lag_pm10median(1)",,,,,
"Looking at so2median, it is also unimodal with a right skewed distribution, and naturally the 7 day average variable, lag_so2median holds the same shape(1)",,,,,
"Looking at o3median, we see it is unimodal and the distribution is right skewed as well(1)",,,,,
"The 7 day average, lag_o3median can be described the same way(1)",,,,,
"Our last explanatory variable temperature, is left skewed with a mean temperature of about 50 degrees fahrenheit(1)",,,,,
"It has almost no outliers, so its mean and median are very close, varying only by 1 degree(1)",,,,,
"The weekly average, lag_tmpd’s shape is the same (1).It is important to note the temperature variables have a bimodal shape, which may affect the accuracy of our results as we will be ignoring that fact",,,,,
Our response variable is the number of non-accidental deaths on a date(2),,,,,
"To make the modeling easier, we have decided to use a log transformation on the death variable(2)",,,,,
"After doing so, we can see in the figure below(4) that the variable has a unimodal symmetric distribution(2)",,,,,
There are outliers on the higher end around the years 1995-1996(3) as shown in the scatterplot of Figure 2,,,,,
"Around this time there was an extreme heat wave in Chicago, which contributed to the higher-than-usual number of deaths(3)",,,,,
"While such an event seems like it should be disregarded in our data, we have chosen to keep it(3)",,,,,
"This is because global warming effects are becoming more and more pronounced each year, and we can expect similar events more often(3)",,,,,
"This data ends in 2001, thus it does not account for the several other heat waves that have occurred since then(3)",,,,,
"To understand the data further, we use a matrix plot to look at the relationship between variables(3) as displayed in the figure below (4)",,,,,
There are a few relationships of notes(3),,,,,
"There is a slight positive correlation between temperature and the 7-day average of O3, lag_O3median(3)",,,,,
"The same holds true for the 7-day average of PM10 pollution, lag_pm10median, and lag_O3median(3)",,,,,
"Looking at the correlations of log_death with the predictors, we observe that the response variable has a notable negative correlation with temperature of -0.39(3)",,,,,
The rest of the correlations with log_death seem to be extremely weak in this format(3),,,,,
"The plots of ozone and temperature over time in Figure 4 and 5 (4,5) show that they are cyclical in nature",,,,,
Each year their levels have peaks and valleys which is expected due to the different seasons(5),,,,,
"Based on these observations, we can expect ozone and temperature may have similar effects on our model(5)",,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics ,,,,,
Now we use the data we have collected to create a model for inference(1),,,,,
"In this case, we put together two Poisson generalized additive models(1)",,,,,
"The first model, which we refer to as the individual model, uses the covariates that are not lagged(1)",,,,,
"The second model, which we refer to as the lagged model, uses the lagged covariates (7 day averages) in place of the unlagged variables(1)",,,,,
"To keep the modelling simple, we have used spline smoother terms for all the variables and set the degrees of freedom to be 4 for all(1)",,,,,
"After putting together the models, we use cross validation to determine which model is the best of the two that we have developed(2)",,,,,
"Here we have used k-fold cross validation, as it is the most commonly used and general form of cross validation(2)",,,,,
The matrix below shows the error we estimated for each model in the first row(2),,,,,
"Based on this, we find the lagged model to be the best fit for the data as it has a smaller error(2)",,,,,
"However, it is good to note that the difference between the two errors is very small(3)",,,,,
The difference between the models is not significant as the models have similar standard errors(3),,,,,
"That being said, once again, the standard error is lower for the lagged model, thus this is the model that we will be using for our results(3)",,,,,
Results ,,,,,
"Beyond just comparing the two models we put together, it is important to understand if the model we selected actually works with our data, rather than just relative to the individual model",,,,,
"For this, we conducted a chi squared goodness of fit test for the lagged model(1)",,,,,
"From this test we obtained a p value of 0.86, which is well above 0.05, telling us that this model is a good fit for the data(1)",,,,,
"Now that we have confirmed that the lagged model is a good fit for the data, we must look to answer the research questions we started with",,,,,
Our aim is to understand the impact of pollutants in the air on mortality,,,,,
We created a hypothesis test to conclude whether or not pollutants have an association with mortality,,,,,
"For this test we had to create a third model with temperature as the only covariate, as we tested the lagged model with all the pollutants against a model where there are no pollutants covariates",,,,,
The ANOVA hypothesis test concluded that the pollutants do have an association with mortality due to the low p-value (less than 0.05)(2),,,,,
"Since we have confirmed our model works well and that these pollutants do have an association with the number of non accidental deaths, we can now analyze the impact timeframe",,,,,
"For the modelling we conducted in the previous section, it is apparent that the effect of pollutants on morality is not instantaneous, but rather extends over time(3)",,,,,
We can confidently state this because we found the instantaneous model (also known as the individual model) to be a worse fit than the lagged model for our data(3),,,,,
The figure below shows the average relationship between each variable and the outcome with +/- 2 standard deviations(4),,,,,
"From these plots, we can see that o3 and temperature have the largest impact",,,,,
"Of the pollutants, o3 definitely appears to be the most associated with mortality(4)",,,,,
"Further exploring these relationships, we calculated the mean number of non accidental deaths if the covariates were at their historical lows, except for lag_temperature, which we set to 70 degrees Fahrenheit(5)",,,,,
This calculation led to a result of 4.68 deaths(5),,,,,
"The 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [4.65,4.70]",,,,,
We also derived this confidence interval using a non parametric bootstrap(6),,,,,
"We found the confidence interval to be [3.49, 5.02] using this method(6)",,,,,
"The bootstrap was repeated 1000 times, however the confidence interval is still much larger than it is for the other method of estimation(7)",,,,,
This is in part due to the assumptions that we use for the bootstrap(7),,,,,
"As a non parametric bootstrap, there are no assumptions except that the observations are independent of one another(7)",,,,,
We did not use a parmetric bootstrap or resampling residuals bootstrap because we cannot comment on the residuals distribution(7),,,,,
Conclusions ,,,,,
Through this analysis it has become clear that the relationship between pollutants and mortality is not favorable(1),,,,,
"As pollutants in the air increase, so do the deaths(1)",,,,,
We found a Poisson generalized additive model of the 7 day averages is the most representative model of this relationship(1),,,,,
This model helped us understand that the pollutant ozone has the strongest association with deaths(1),,,,,
"Additionally, the effect is not a day by day basis, but rather extends over time(1)",,,,,
We know this because our chosen model fits better than an instantaneous model(1),,,,,
"Using the model, we were able to calculate that if the pollutants were at their historical lows on a 70 degree day, there would be about 4 deaths(was exactly 4.68 deaths) on average (1)",,,,,
"The 95% confidence interval for the mean number of deaths is [4.65,4.70](1)",,,,,
"Unfortunately, you cannot conclude that reducing pollutants would definitely cause mortality to decrease because the analysis done here does not prove causation, only association(2,3)",,,,,
We only used observational data here(2),,,,,
"However, that would be an educated guess, and you should definitely consider it further(2)",,,,,
"There are limitations to this analysis beyond the lack of causation(2,3)",,,,,
"This analysis does not look at any pollutants beside ozone, sulfur dioxide, and particulate matter(3)",,,,,
Gases such as nitrogen were not part of this analysis(3),,,,,
"Additionally, the data we are using is over 20 years old, thus the atmosphere will most likely have a different composition in real time(3)",,,,,
"Lastly,while our sample size was sufficient, we would have more accuracy with a larger sample of days(3)",,,,,
"When it comes to our bootstrap, we could have run more iterations for accuracy even though 1000 was sufficient(3) Overall, we have found some headway on the path to immortality and as more research is done, we hope to draw more conclusive research",,,,,
