"Introduction: With practices of fire suppression have continued since the early 19th century, wildfires have become increasingly common and increasingly severe in recent years.",,,
"This is a dangerous escalation, and puts thousands at risk.",,,
"As such, it is important to understand the trends of wild fires, in order to help firefighters anticipate fire hazards and protect vulnerable populations.",,,
"Additionally, examining patterns in fire damage can help reveal the situational weaknesses of fire departments and allow them to better prepare.",,,
"Environmental factors such as humidity levels and temperature clearly have an effect on fire potency; however, human factors such as day of the week and time of the year may be just as influential in determining the effectiveness of the response.",,,
In this study — https://www.usfa.fema.gov/current_events/020118.html — it is apparent that firefighter turnout time is dramatically dependent on the time of day; how might the same effect be seen on a large scale?,,,
"Our goal is to explore this question, thus allowing fire departments to social engineer their teams.",,,
"Data: We have data from 517 individual fires in a region of Portugal, recorded over a span of three years by the Braganca Polytechnic Institute in the center of the Montesinho park.",,,
Each set of data was compiled within 30 minutes of a fire occurring.,,,
"Our primary focus will be on the total area burned by each fire, a quantitative variable describing the scale of each fire in hectares; the mean area burned was 12.895 hectares, with a standard deviation of 63.646 hectares.",,,
"Our research questions, seen below, will also include day of the week and month of the year.",,,
"The day of the week is a categorical variable describing which day of the week a fire occurred, while month of the year is a categorical variable describing during which month a fire occurred.",,,
"This variables were selected because they may be helpful in tracking firefighter’s fatigue throughout the course of the week and, on a larger scale, the fire season.",,,
"The earliest fires occurred in January, with only two recorded fires, while the latest occurred in December, with nine recorded fires.",,,
"This illustrates that fires occur year round, although it will be shown later that there is a definite fire season.",,,
"We will also examine the Initial Spread Index with relation to each month, in order to extrapolate the extent to which environmental factors (such as fire season) interact with human factors.",,,
"Research Scenarios: Establishing the Effects of Fire Season by Month (environmental factors) Our first question will explore the importance of the time of year on fire severity as related to purely environmental factors, such as wind, humidity levels, and temperature.",,,
"In order to consolidate these factors, we will be using the Initial Spread Index to indicate the velocity with which the fire spread.",,,
"The Initial Spread Index was chosen to examine all environmental factors, as it itself is dependent on the combination of elements listed above.",,,
"The distribution of the Initial Spread Index is shown below, in Figure 1.",,,
"This histogram provides us with two important features of fire season, namely the median ISI score by month (x-axis) and the frequency of fire occurrences per month (y-axis).",,,
"Visually, it is clear that the two keystone months for fires are August and September.",,,
"They have fires occur at dramatically higher frequencies — as seen in Table 2 below, 184 fires were recorded in August and 172 fires were recorded in September.",,,
"With the data analyzing 517 total fires, this means that 68.8% of fires occurred over the span of two months.",,,
"However, despite the substantial increase in fire occurrences, the median ISI of August and September are 10.6 and 8.1, respectively.",,,
"The other median ISI are not dramatically lower than those seen in August and September (omitting the ISI seen in the winter months, which typically hover between 1 and 3).",,,
"The graph has a slight skew left, and sees a high outlier in the month of June, with an ISI between 50 and 60.",,,
"Further summarizing the relationship between ISI and month, it is important to note that months with higher fire frequencies also had higher max ISIs.",,,
"November, for example, only had one fire occurrence and had a max ISI of 1.1; similarly, January had 2 fires and a max ISI of 2.9.",,,
"Comparatively, March had 54 fires and a max ISI of 12.5, and August and September both had upwards of 170 fires and max ISIs of 22.6.",,,
Exploring the Total Area Burned Dependent on Month of Occurrence Now we examine the effect month has on the severity of each fire based on the fire department’s capabilities.,,,
"There is a clear relationship between month and area burned, as seen in Figure 2 below, for a myriad of reasons that will be outlined in the discussion.",,,
"Additionally, the media area burned climbs throughout fire season as well: June had a median of .1 ha, while September had a median of 1.36 hectares.",,,
"July, August, and September have standard deviations of 50.837 ha, 60.355 ha, and 87.639 ha respectively.",,,
"The increased standard deviation despite the increased sample size (standard deviation normally decreases with an increased sample size) is extremely interesting, and reveals two important details for our examination of the second question: first, fires are more unpredictable later in the season, which could be a reflection of the fire departments, and second, with such dramatic deviations, that there are limitations to the trend seen in Figure 2.",,,
"Based on Table 2 and Figure 2, as well as the conclusions drawn based on Table 1 and Figure 1, there is a clear interaction between month of the area and fire severity, which was expected.",,,
"Essentially, fire season does exist!",,,
"However, it is interesting to see that fire season does not have stagnant statistics; fires become bigger and more variant later in the season.",,,
"Thus, the nature of this interaction needs to be further explored — is it due to human error?",,,
Sheer volume of forest fires?,,,
Environmental factors that lend themselves to the fire spread?,,,
Figure 3 offers a visual relating the ISI of recorded fires each month to the area burned by recorded fires each month; the plot is a bit of a mess between ISI of 20 and 300 ha burned.,,,
"However, tellingly, we see fire season months (July, August, and September) have area outliers at relatively similar Initial Spread Indexes.",,,
"These outliers point to the importance of human factors in determining the effects of fires, although there are other potential explanatory features that will be discussed later.",,,
"Exploring the Total Area Burned Dependent on Day of the Week This section most dissects human attitude towards conceptions of time and performance at work, in this case, fire fighting.",,,
"Because weeks are shorter, more repetitive, and less affected by environmental factors, it is easier to isolate social behaviors and their effect on fire departments responses.",,,
"Before analyzing the data, it is important to note that each day of the week had a relatively uniform number of fires recorded; thus, the difference in area burned cannot be attributed to over-stretching resources due to more fires caused by camping or other recreational activities that may cause more fires on weekends.",,,
"Looking at Figure 4, it can be seen that each day of the week had similar five-number summaries; the third quartile for each day ranges from 5.058 ha to 8.99 ha, meaning that, on average, 75% of fires each day are burn within 4 ha of each other.",,,
"That being said, there are a few interesting data points.",,,
"For example, Tuesdays have a higher third quartile than any other day by over a hectare, although they have a standard median and max.",,,
"Additionally, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday see significantly lower medians than the other days of the week, with their medians ranging from .1 to .39.",,,
"This is surprising, as we would have expected more fires due to more recreation on the weekends.",,,
"However, maybe departments are more prepared for fires on these days for the same reason we were expecting to see higher medians these days, allowing them to more efficiently stop the fires from burning.",,,
"Overall, there are no substantial differences in the area burned by fires by day of week; this illustrates that, at least on a weekly basis, firefighters and departments are just as prepared to handle fires on any one of the week as they are on another.",,,
They don’t fall victim to day-to-day fatigue.,,,
"Discussion: Our analysis looked at 517 recorded fires over the course of 3 years, and examined the extent to which situation, human fatigue, and preparedness affected the ability of fire departments to control fires.",,,
"This study found that, on a small, week-to-week scale, fire departments handled fires with the same amount of skill, and even were more efficient in controlling fires on weekends with increased fire risk.",,,
"However, on a larger scale, there are differences in the area burned by fires that cannot solely be attributed to the environmental factors we examined in this study.",,,
"The ISI increase throughout the year follows the increase in area burned during fire season; that being said, the ISI is stable between each fire season month and does not explain the increased burn area from June to September.",,,
"This could be due to human factors, such as loss of resources and long-term fatigue, or environmental factors, such as more vulnerable ecosystems.",,,
The analysis of the area burned by day would make it seem as if the increase in area burned between fire season months is due to factors that are not social.,,,
"Overall, our analysis indicates no relationship between fatigue and firefighting.",,,
