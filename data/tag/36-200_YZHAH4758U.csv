Introduction: Is “justice” always equal?,,,
"In most countries, justice is served in civil lawsuits by determining the amount of money a plaintiff’s damages are worth, then awarding the plaintiff the money.",,,
"Even though it is difficult to quantify a qualitative amount of damages, civil lawsuits often result in a surprisingly wide range of outcomes.",,,
"Sometimes, a plaintiff is awarded with 0 of their demanded damages, while in other cases plaintiffs are awarded with more damages than they even asked for.",,,
"Our goal in analyzing these data is to determine whether this is a significant issue that should be taken into consideration, and what may be correlated with these outcomes.",,,
"Data: The data being analyzed is a 2001 Civil Justice Survey of State Courts examining civil cases in the 75 most populous states in the United States, located at isle.stat.cmu.edu.",,,
"The primary variable of interest in this report is totalDamages, a quantitative variable that indicates the amount of damages (in dollars) awarded to the plaintiff by the court.",,,
"The mean total damages is $213101, and the standard deviation being $1837561.",,,
"While this variable is useful to determine how damages are awarded differently across civil cases, it is sometimes more useful to consider the qualitative variable settledLow, that indicates whether the difference between the demanded amount and the total damages is positive (the case settled lower than asked, so settledLow = true) or nonpositive (the case settled at or above the amount asked, so settledLow = false).",,,
"Also included in this report are variables demanded, which is the amount of damages initially demanded by the plaintiff, and the group of variables defGovt, defHosp, and defCorp, indicating the type of defendant in the case (government, hospital, or corporation, respectively).",,,
Examining the Distribution of Settlement Amounts Our first question is how are the settlement amounts recorded in this data set distributed by amount recorded.,,,
We hypothesize that cases with a low settlement amount are much more common than those with high settlement amounts.,,,
"We examine two figures, both distributions of total damages.",,,
"In figure 1, the data is so skewed right that the bars are barely visible.",,,
"The skewness of the graph indicates there are a few outliers in the dataset, each with very high settlement amounts.",,,
"The mean value of total damages, as previously shown, is $213,101.",,,
"However, the median value of total damages is just $7,795.",,,
This large discrepancy demonstrates the extreme degree of skew in the total damages distribution.,,,
The interquartile range of total damages ranges from $0 at the 25th percentile to $50315 at the 75th percentile.,,,
"As 25% of cases settle for nothing, there is further evidence that the few outliers must be very large in order to create such a high mean settlement amount.",,,
Demanded vs. TotalDamages Correlation Our second question is to determine whether there is a relationship between the amount a plaintiff demands and the amount of damages awarded.,,,
"The scatter plot relating the initial demand to the final settlement, as shown in figure 3, appears to show little correlation between the two figures for the average case.",,,
"The data points are densest near the x-axis, reflecting the observation that at least 25% of cases settle for $0 from part 1.",,,
"Most other data points that do not lie near the x-axis seem to be outliers, so no relationship can be defined.",,,
"If there were a relationship between amount demanded and amount rewarded, it would have a nearly horizontal slope due to the large number of cases that settle for close to $0.",,,
"The outliers in the scatterplot reveal an interesting pattern: in outlying cases, there are two likely scenarios.",,,
"Either the plaintiff demands a high number and is awarded much less, or the plaintiff demands a low number and is awarded much more than they asked for.",,,
"There are few outlying cases where the demanded amount and the total amount were both high, but similar in size.",,,
Settlement Amount by Case Type Our third question is to look into whether there is a relationship between case type and the amount awarded in the settlement.,,,
"In order to avoid single outliers manipulating the average settlement amount for each type of case, I made a new variable, settledLow, instead to indicate whether the case settled at/above or below the amount asked.",,,
"Given the financial power corporations typically have, I hypothesize that the percentage of cases that settled lower than the demand for cases where the defendant was a corporation is lower than the percentage of cases that settled lower for cases with the government or a hospital as the defendant.",,,
"In order to conduct this analysis, we make three contingency tables measuring settledLow vs. each case type.",,,
"First, we observe that the sample size of the cases with a hospital as the defendant is much smaller than the sample size of cases with a corporation as the defendant.",,,
"The sample size of cases with the government as the defendant is also small, but not as small as the amount of defHosp cases.",,,
"In order to explore our question, we calculated the percentage of cases in each case type that settled low out of the total number of cases in that type.",,,
"Contrary to our hypothesis, the lowest percentage of cases that settled low was in corporate defense cases, with just 71.7% of cases settling low.",,,
Comparing the percentage of cases that settled low in corporate cases with the percentages of cases that settled low in hospital and government cases contradicts our hypothesis.,,,
"In hospital defendant cases, 95.2% of cases settled low.",,,
Government defendant cases settled low 83.2% of the time.,,,
"The reason for this relationship is still unknown, but perhaps something to look into in future studies.",,,
"Discussion: Our analysis examined data of 1836 civil court cases and the amount the plaintiff of each case demanded, was awarded, and how that data changed based on the type of case.",,,
"While we did not see a strong relationship between the amount demanded and awarded, we found that there is a relationship between the case type and whether the plaintiff is awarded at least as much as they asked.",,,
"Based on the data explored in this analysis, it seems that at least 25% of civil cases settle for $0, and the outliers in which the plaintiff is awarded much more than they asked for skew the data right.",,,
"In the future, it may be interesting to look into the reasons corporate cases often settle at or above the amount asked.",,,
The outliers in this dataset are what seem to be most interesting though.,,,
"Perhaps instead of collecting large amounts of data again, it would be useful to look into the individual outlying cases and see what factors are influencing the outcome of each case.",,,
