"Introduction In the modern world, video streaming technologies consistently maintain an enormous sense of popularity.",,,
"YouTube in particular, having garnered even more users this past year as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, remains at the forefront of the video-sharing world.",,,
But what specifically renders the platform so popular?,,,
What kinds of videos do the majority of users tend to drift towards?,,,
And how do video genre preferences differ by country?,,,
"As such, this report will focus on the varying popularity of the different categories of YouTube videos, as well as which countries favor these categories the most.",,,
"Dataset The primary variable of focus for this study is the viewsPerVideo, a quantitative variable that represents the average amount of views that a specific YouTube channel will receive on each video uploaded.",,,
"Our research questions additionally emphasize country and continent, both of which specify the general location of each subscriber; the country variable appears to be more specific, but with the given database we will find that the generalization of data by continent renders the data easier to analyze.",,,
"Another variable of interest is category, which describes the genre of the uploaded video and its overall channel.",,,
"As shown in the frequency table above, the majority of channels are based in the Americas, which has a grand total of 634.",,,
"Africa has the lowest, with the total number of African-based channels ending up at 16.",,,
Research Scenarios Our first question focuses on which video category is the most popular among viewers holistically.,,,
"Based on the evidence as provided below, we hypothesize that entertainment is the most popular category of YouTube video.",,,
"As shown by the set of histograms above, the category Entertainment has the greatest overall range of values, with a maximum of 27.765M and a minimum of 107.968K.",,,
"However, it has a relatively small median value of 1.968M in comparison to music, with a median value of 2.085M, as well as Comedy, with the greatest median value of 2.935M.",,,
"After noting the high median value of Comedy, we can also note that it has the highest third quartile value of 5.437M, as well as the highest upper fence value of all of the categories: 10.164M.",,,
"Using this data, we may infer that our initial hypothesis was incorrect and that Entertainment is not the most popular category of video; rather, Comedy garners more subscribers despite its lower variability.",,,
Our second question focuses on the size of the user base for each country on the platform.,,,
"Since YouTube is based in North America and much of its content seems to be created there, we hypothesize that North America has the greatest amount of YouTube users.",,,
"As depicted by the bar graph above, the United States (shown in light blue) had the greatest number of videos with the greatest amount of views.",,,
"As shown by the bar graph above, the Americas are the continent with the greatest amount of channels, with a total of 634.",,,
"Africa has the least number of channels, hosting only 16.",,,
"Using Figures 3 and 4, we can confirm our hypothesis that North America has the largest user base, as out of all of the countries, the United States has the highest views per video, and the Americas continents had the greatest number of channels.",,,
Our third question characterizes the distribution of channel category.,,,
"Since entertainment has already been proven to be the most viewed video category, we hypothesize that the greatest amount of channels appears within the entertainment category as well.",,,
"According to the bar graph above, there are 257 entertainment channels in the Americas, which is the highest number of channels overall across all of the continents.",,,
"Within each continent, the entertainment category has the highest number of channels.",,,
"Therefore, by the data observed from Figure 5, we can confirm our hypothesis that the greatest amount of YouTube channels appears within the entertainment category.",,,
Discussion Our analysis focused primarily on category popularity as well as user base.,,,
"We gathered that comedy is the most popular video category, and that the majority of YouTube’s user base is located in the United States.",,,
"We additionally observed that the most popular channel to exist on the platform is entertainment, despite comedy channels having the most subscribers overall.",,,
"The data analysis could have been improved by going more into depth within each continent or even country- for example, observing the user base of individual states within the United States.",,,
"Considering additional variables would have helped the study as well, such as economical stability as well as cultural preferences for media content.",,,
"Overall, this study and the data gathered from it may help to inform advertising companies which types of videos on YouTube to market advertisements on.",,,
This study may also help YouTube as a company better understand its user base and its video streaming preferences.,,,
