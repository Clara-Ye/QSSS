"Introduction: In today’s society, a large emphasis is placed on entertainment.",,,
"To get the entertainment they want, many people turn to YouTube, where they can watch videos posted by people all around the world.",,,
"If a viewer enjoys an uploader’s content, they can subscribe to the user.",,,
"One of the ways many people view success in the social media community is by looking at the number of subscribers a channel has: the more subscribers, the more successful.",,,
Our goal in the current work is therefore to better understand what makes a channel more popular and have more subscribers than others.,,,
"Data: We have collected a sample of 1,259 YouTube channels with information up until 2018, collected by SocialBlade, a website that tracks social media statistics and analytics, mostly used by many YouTube channels.",,,
"Our primary focus in this study will be on the variable subscribers, a quantitative variable measuring the number of people subscribed to a channel (measured by people).",,,
"Based on the values calculated below in Table 1, we can see that the mean number of subscribers across all YouTube channels analyzed was 3,201,757.576 people, the median number of subscribers was 1,949,612 people, and the standard deviation of the number of subscribers was 3,556,605.298 people.",,,
"Our research questions will take a look into whether the channel content category, the country of origin, and the number of views affect the number of subscribers one receives.",,,
"The channel content category is a categorical variable indicating what type of videos gets uploaded by that channel, ranging from comedy to education to gaming; we can see from Table 2 that the most popular category is Entertainment, consisting of 517 channels in our dataset.",,,
The country of origin is also a categorical variable that gives information about the channel’s country of origin.,,,
"Based on Figure 1, we notice that the United States dominates other countries in channel count when it comes to looking at the country of origin of the channel.",,,
This would make sense since YouTube is an American-made company.,,,
The number of views is a quantitative variable that gives information about the number of viewers each channel has across all of their videos uploaded.,,,
"Based on Table 3, we are able to notice quite a large mean number of views across all videos in all channels: 1,346,843,185.938 views.",,,
"In our research questions, we will take a look at how these values affect a channel’s subscriber count.",,,
Our first research question will investigate whether there is a relationship between the channel’s content category and the number of subscribers they have.,,,
"Because of the diversity between different content categories, it is likely and safe to hypothesize that there will be different distributions between the number of subscribers depending on what category each channel falls in.",,,
We will first take a look at the mean and standard deviation of each different category to get a summary of how the content category affects the subscriber count.,,,
"We notice that there is quite some variation between different categories: News & Politics and Education channels seem to have the lowest number of subscribers on average, while Comedy channels seem to dominate the subscriber count by a lot on average.",,,
"It is also important to note that each category appears to have a large standard deviation, showing great variation between data values.",,,
"To get a clearer comparison between different categories, we will chart the relationship between content category and subscriber count using a box plot, giving side-by-side comparisons, in Figure 2.",,,
"From the box plot shown in Figure 2, we can note that the median subscriber count is noticeably higher in comedy channels (note that the data is scaled in the millions).",,,
"If we take that data and compare it to our mean values in Table 4, we see that there is a similar result when looking at the Comedy category; comedy has both the highest mean and median.",,,
"We must also note that there are quite a few outliers throughout all of the categories, the most noticeable one being in Entertainment and Gaming, with a subscriber count of more than 25 million people and a subscriber count just under 25 million people, respectively.",,,
We can see a difference between each category’s mean and median.,,,
"However, because of the similar values of subscriber count, and the many outliers that seem to affect the data, we are unable to conclusively say there is a relationship between a channel’s content category and the subscriber count.",,,
Our next research question investigates whether the channel’s country of origin affects the number of subscribers one gets on YouTube.,,,
YouTube is an American-made online streaming company that was started in 2005.,,,
"Because it is American-made, there would be more advertising done in America than in any other country, and more Americans would have more knowledge and use YouTube more than other countries.",,,
"Therefore, we can hypothesize that channels originating in America will have a higher subscriber count than those in other countries.",,,
"We must first take another look at how many channels there are per country, which is shown with a bar graph above in Figure 1.",,,
"By examining the bar graph, we can see that the United States dominates the number of channels, and naturally, we can hypothesize that they would have the most number of subscribers when combining all their channels due to the number of channels that originated in the United States.",,,
"However, this research question focuses on whether or not the country of origin plays a role in seeing how many subscribers channels get.",,,
"To dive deeper into this question, we will make a box plot showing the relation between channel subscriptions and country of origin.",,,
"While we can see that channels that originated in Korea had a greater median count, we also see a lot of overlap when looking at the interquartile ranges.",,,
"Therefore, we would not be able to conclude that channels started in Korea would have a greater subscriber count, which also disproves our hypothesis.",,,
Our third research question investigates whether there is a relationship between the total number of views and the number of subscribers a channel has.,,,
We will attempt to characterize a relationship if there is one between the two values.,,,
YouTube has a unique recommendation algorithm.,,,
"If it thinks a user would like a video, then they will recommend that video on their home page.",,,
This often causes people to receive recommendations from videos that are years old.,,,
"Because YouTube’s subscription feature basically calculates the popularity of a channel, the number of views received heavily affects the number of subscribers a channel gets.",,,
"If a channel appears on someone’s recommended page, let’s say Person A for this example, they are more likely to view that video, which increases the total view count.",,,
"As this happens, YouTube continues recommending that video to other people who share similar viewing habits with Person A, leading to a domino effect.",,,
"If more people continue to view that video, then the view counter increases, which spreads more popularity, which leads to a greater chance of getting more subscribers.",,,
"Because of this, it is safe to hypothesize that there is a direct relationship between view count and subscriber count: the more total views, the more subscribers.",,,
"To help visualize the relationship between total view count and subscriber count, we will make a scatterplot down.",,,
"We notice that we have two different lines, one that is a linear fit, and the other being a smoothed fit.",,,
"Both of those lines are sufficiently linear, showing that when the amount of total views a channel gets increases, the subscriber count also increases.",,,
We do see a pretty noticeable cluster at the start of the graph when the number of views is less than 5 billion.,,,
This is to be expected since many channels with a lower view count could also have many subscribers.,,,
"However, as the amount of views increases, we can see the number of subscribers increase as well.",,,
The line of best fit also divides the two sections well.,,,
We also notice a few outliers when the number of views reaches > 15 billion.,,,
"When we look at the two lines of best fit graphed, we see that the linear fit is under the smoothed fit.",,,
The smoothed fit tries to smooth things out to help predict a better model.,,,
"Based on the linear display of the data values, we can conclude that chances are, when the number of views increases, the number of subscribers will also increase.",,,
Discussion: Our analysis focused on the subscriber count of YouTube channels up until the end of 2018.,,,
"We questioned possible relationships with content category, country of origin, and the number of total views.",,,
"When looking at the content category, we were unable to come to a conclusion about whether or not the category affected subscriber count.",,,
"While the relationship between subscriber count and the country of origin showed that channels that originated in Korea had a higher mean and median, there was not enough data to generalize that having a channel that originated in Korea would lead to more subscribers.",,,
"Our final research question yielded some results that showed that as the number of total viewers for a channel increases, it is likely that the number of subscribers would also increase.",,,
"In the future, we could account for more data within each channel, like whether or not they have sponsors for videos, whether or not they advertise their videos, how long their videos are, etc.",,,
since many of these seem to affect the subscriber count in today’s society.,,,
"Overall, our analysis gave content creators an idea as to what influences the number of subscribers they have and what does not.",,,
