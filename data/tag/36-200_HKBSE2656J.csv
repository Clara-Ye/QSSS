"Introduction: Forest Fires, if not properly prepared for, can be extremely damaging to the environment and dangerous to society.",,,
There are ways to predict and subsequently minimize the damage caused by forest fires as reported by BBC (https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180924-the-quest-to-predict-and-stop-the-spread-of-wildfires).,,,
"Specifically, environmental indicators such as temperature and humidity offer loads of information as to the possibility of potential forest fires.",,,
It is crucial to the environment and to society as a whole that we diminish the consequences of unforeseen and uncontrollable forest fires.,,,
Our goal is to more accurately predict the occurrence of forest fires.,,,
This could help fire departments and citizens in danger better prepare for the natural disaster.,,,
Dataset: Our given information is from a sample of 517 forest fires.,,,
The forest fire data is from the Montesinho natural park in the northeast region of Portugal and was collected from January 2000 to December 2003.,,,
The variable we will focus on is the total burned area: a quantitative variable that describes the amount of area the forest fire burned through (measured in ha).,,,
The total area burned ranges from 0.1 ha to 1090.84 ha.,,,
The mean of the total area burned is 12.90 ha and the standard deviation of the total area burned is 63.65 ha.,,,
Our research questions will also involve the Fine Fuel Moisture Code and the month of the year.,,,
The variable Fine Fuel Moisture Code is a quantitative variable that describes moisture content surface litter and is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the flammability of fine fuel.,,,
The mean of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code is 90.65 and the standard deviation of the FFMC is 5.52.,,,
The month of the year is a categorical variable indicating which month the forest fire occurred in.,,,
The month with the most amount of forest fires was August with 184 forest fires.,,,
The month with the least amount of forest fires was November with 1 forest fire.,,,
Research Scenarios: Our first question will be to characterize the distribution of the total area burned by forest fires.,,,
"We hypothesize that the typical total area burned by a forest fire will be small (less than about 10 ha) Through the histogram of the total area burned (figure 1), we can observe that the majority of forest fires burn between 0 - 10 ha of land which supports our initial hypothesis.",,,
This could be because firefighters work fast to try to minimize the spread and following damage of forest fires.,,,
"The distribution of Total Area Burned (figure 1) shows one primary mode around 0 - 10 ha, and is strongly right-skewed and has a couple of outliers at around 750 and 1090 ha.",,,
Our next research question is to investigate whether the total area burned by forest fires is associated with the month of the year and characterize the association if there is one.,,,
"Since it is likely that weather changes and seasonal changes that are associated with different months of the year can affect the likelihood of forest fires occurring, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that different months will have differing numbers of forest fires.",,,
We first summarize total forest fires by each month.,,,
"This is summarized in table 1, below.",,,
"From table 1, we can see that most forest fires occur in the fall months, August and September.",,,
"Furthermore, we can see that fewer forest fires occur in the winter months, November, December and January, and spring months, April and May.",,,
We can also investigate the relationship between the number of forest fires and the months of the year through a pie chart (figure 2).,,,
Our third research question is to investigate whether there is a relationship between the fine fuel moisture code (FFMC) and the total area burned by the forest fire and to describe the relationship if it exists.,,,
"Since the FFMC is an indicator of the relative ease of ignition and the possible intensity of the fire, it would make sense that fires that burned larger areas would have a higher FFMC.",,,
This is illustrated by the scatterplot (figure 3) below.,,,
"Taking a look at figure 3, it is clear the left-skewed nature of the data.",,,
It is significantly denser near 80-100 FFMC.,,,
This shows that higher FFMC might be an indicator for forest fires that burn larger areas of land.,,,
"However, taking a look at the linear regression model in table 2 above, we see that the standard error is quite large and so while it could be said that there is somewhat of a linear relationship between FFMC and total area burned, there is not a strong correlation between the two variables.",,,
Discussion: The analysis was centered on predictors of forest fires for a sample of 517 forest fires in Montesinho natural park in the northeast region of Portugal from January 2000 to December 2003.,,,
"Specifically, we focused on the relationships between the number of forest fires and the total area burned by forest fires, and FFMC and the month of the year.",,,
We discovered that forest fires are more likely to occur in certain months (in particular fall months such as August and September when the weather is cooler and drier).,,,
This finding was expected.,,,
We also found that FFMC can somewhat be used to predict the intensity of forest fires.,,,
The relationship is not strong but that may just be because of the size of our sample.,,,
Our findings were possibly limited by the fact that the sample size was small and only from a certain area.,,,
"Thus, our conclusions may not be able to be generalized to places outside of the northeast region of Portugal.",,,
Future analysis might take a look at forest fires in other regions of the world such as California.,,,
Other analysts could take a part in looking at forest fires in different locations.,,,
"Additionally, it might include pollution or air quality as a variable of consideration since the quality/cleanliness of the air might have some effect on the speed and range that a forest fire spreads to.",,,
"All in all, our analysis could be used by environmentalists, firefighters, first responders, or even just people living in areas prone to forest fires.",,,
These people could use this information to plan to combat forest fires or mitigate the damages caused by forest fires.,,,
