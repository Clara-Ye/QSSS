Introduction Medical expenses are extremely high and unaffordable for the average citizen without health insurance premiums.,,,
"These premiums are determined by insurance companies based on the subscriber’s age, medical history, and lifestyle habits.",,,
"However, high-risk subscribers for ischemic heart disease may be charged more for the additional amount of medical services they might use.",,,
"As a result, we strive to better understand the relationship between their total cost of claims and their medical history during the claim period by examining different variables that could possibly be associated with increased cost claims.",,,
This examination may provide useful information to insurance companies as well as subscribers in evaluating the appropriate costs of health insurance premiums for heart disease patients.,,,
Data We have a sample of 788 subscribers during the period of January 1998 to December 1999.,,,
"Our investigation will mainly be on the variable cost, which is a quantitative variable measuring the total cost of claims by subscribers in dollars($).",,,
The average costs across the 788 subscribers are $2799.96 with a standard deviation of $6690.26 (calculated in table 1).,,,
Other variables that we will also examine along with costs are interventions and drugs.,,,
Interventions is a quantitative variable that indicates the total number of interventions or procedures carried out.,,,
The mean number of interventions is 4.71 and the standard deviation is 5.60 (calculated in table 2).,,,
"Drugs is a categorical variable that categorizes the number of drugs prescribed (0 for none, 1 for one, and 2 for more than one).",,,
"Data shows that 77.4% (610 out of 788) subscribers had no drugs prescribed, 11.3% (89 out of 788) had 1 drug prescribed, and 11.3% (89 out of 788) had more than one drug prescribed to them (as shown in Figure 2).",,,
Scenario 1: Cost Distributions of Subscribers Our first research question will examine the distribution of cost among the 788 subscribers with ischemic heart disease.,,,
"Our hypothesis is that most subscribers’ costs will be under 20,000 dollars.",,,
"From Figure 1, we can see that our data is unimodal and heavily skewed to the right.",,,
The mode (most frequent) claim amount falls between -$500-$499.,,,
There seem to be several very high outliers (towards the end of the right tail) as well.,,,
The mean cost is several bins away from the mode at $2799.96 while the median is just a little over to the right of the mode at $507.20.,,,
The standard deviation is relatively large compared to the mean at $6690.26.,,,
The interquartile range has a 25th percentile of $161.05 and a 75th percentile of $1924.60.,,,
"As a result, we can conclude that our hypothesis was supported by the data as the majority of the costs are below $10,000.",,,
The data further shows that most costs are actually well below the average and closer to the median instead.,,,
"Because the data is so strongly skewed to the right, the median is a better representation of the overall sample as it is more resistant to the outliers, unlike the mean.",,,
Scenario 2: Association between Interventions and Cost Our second research question will determine and characterize the association between the number of interventions and cost if one exists.,,,
We hypothesize that there will be a positive correlation between these two variables as the increase the number of interventions/procedures received could suggest an increase in the cost of total claims.,,,
"As shown in Figure 3, we plotted the number of interventions against the cost with a linear regression line.",,,
We can see that the scatterplot is relatively linear.,,,
"Table 3 above shows the calculated correlation coefficient of approximately 0.7 and since most of our data follows the direction of the upwards-sloping linear regression line, we can conclude that there is a strong, positive correlation between the two variables.",,,
"Since we are able to establish a linear association between interventions and cost, we can further interpret the intercept and slope of the regression line.",,,
"Table 4 displays the calculated regressions values that gives us the equation of the regression line in the Figure 3 which is approximately: Based on the equation, we can predict that the cost is -$1290.65 (realistically assume to be 0 since it is not possible to pay negative amounts), on average, when the number of interventions is 0.",,,
"We can also predict that the cost increases by $869.08, on average, when the number of interventions increases by 1.",,,
Scenario 3: Dependency of Cost on Drugs Our last research question will examine whether the cost is associated with the amount of drugs prescribed to the subscriber and to evaluate the relationship if it exists.,,,
"It is reasonable to assume that the more drugs prescribed, the higher the total cost will be.",,,
"However, if the subscriber regularly needs medication for their treatment, it is also possible for them to receive discounts or deals for the amount of prescribed drugs they have.",,,
We have summarized the costs by the categories of drugs in Table 5 below.,,,
"From table 5, we can see that the average cost varies across the 3 categories of drugs.",,,
The subscribers who had no drugs prescribed to them had the lowest average cost and those who had more than one drug prescribed had the highest average cost which is within expectations.,,,
"However, the difference between category 0 and 1 is $2099.38 while the difference between category 1 and 2 is only $903.92.",,,
"Even though we notice similar patterns in some measurements such as the average and median cost across some drug categories, the overall spread and size of the box plots across all 3 groups are all fairly similar with only small variations.",,,
These differences could be merely due to sampling variation or other lurking variables that were not considered in this research question.,,,
"Thus, we do not have sufficient evidence to conclude that the amount of total claim costs is related to the category of prescribed drug amounts.",,,
Discussion We examined the total cost of claims by subscriber from a sample of 788 health insurance premium subscribers between January 1998 to December 1999.,,,
"We also looked at a few other variables, the number of interventions and the category of drugs, in relation to the cost.",,,
"Our analysis found a positive correlation between intervention and cost, as hypothesized, but not a clear association between drugs and cost.",,,
"One limitation in our analysis was that we do not know if our sample was randomized, so our evaluations may or may not be representative of the entire population of health insurance subscribers with ischemic heart disease.",,,
"In addition, several given variables in the data were too general.",,,
"For example, the type of intervention performed was not specified or the type of drug prescribed to the subscribers.",,,
Different procedures and drugs can change the total cost in many ways.,,,
Providing these additional information could greatly affect our data analysis and lead to more accurate evaluations.,,,
"Future investigations could also include the socioeconomic status since wealthier subscribers can afford a better diet and lifestyle, which could improve their health conditions and thus lower costs.",,,
"Nonetheless, our investigation can give health insurance companies as well as subscribers a better understanding of their total cost claims.",,,
"We hope that as a result, health insurances would be able to provide their subscribers with more accurate premiums and that subscribers can better plan for the cost of their heart disease treatments.",,,
