"Introduction YouTube has been one of the most visited websites since its official launch in 2005, starting with reportedly eight million plus videos being watched every day (as reported by The Atlantic, Aug 3, 2011: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/08/infographic-the-history-of-video-advertising-on-youtube/242836/).",,,
"While YouTube remains one of the top websites on the internet, little is known of its global impact as well as the intricacies of each viral video.",,,
"As monetization is a fairly new aspect of social media, it is important to see which parts of the world are actually benefitting from this new facet of a modernized career as well as what factors contribute to successful channels.",,,
"Data There is information on YouTube channel viewing metrics and other data gathered by Social Blade, beginning in 2005 and ending in 2018.",,,
This report will focus on the variable views in order to explore if accounts with a longer origin experienced higher success rates in videos therefore increasing their monetization.,,,
This is a quantitative variable measuring the total amount of views a monetized channel has received (measured in views); the mean for this variable was 1346843185.938 views and the standard deviation was 2036809998.695 views.,,,
The research questions will also include country and account age.,,,
The variable country is a categorical variable indicating where a YouTube channel was created.,,,
The United States had the highest number of monetized channels with 595 accounts and Italy had the lowest number with 8 accounts.,,,
The variable account age is a quantitative variable measuring when a channel was made and how long it was active for (measured in weeks); the mean account age was 305.056 weeks and the standard deviation was 173.080 weeks.,,,
Distinguishing the Amount of Views The first question will be to distinguish the amount of views monetized channels received during the 13 year time period.,,,
"It is hypothesized that, based on the evidence, that most channels receive around 1,000,000,000 as they must reach a quota of subscribers and views in order to receive monetization.",,,
"Utilizing figure 1 below, it can be seen that channels typically receive a minimum of about 11 million views, however, the majority of channels received about 500 million to 2.5 billion views; all with around the same amount of subscribers.",,,
This could be due to the popularity of of YouTube in a specific country or the accessibility to internet.,,,
Amount of Views Based on Country of Origin The next research question is to examine whether there is a connection between the amount of views a channel receives and the origin of the channel.,,,
It is hypothesized that the United States will receive more views per channel as YouTube is extremely popularized and pursued as a career amongst younger generations.,,,
"This is a vital aspect to factor when considering the over-all success rate of monetized channels, regarding views, as there is less of a chance for more views if there are less YouTube channels to divide the work and balance the statistics.",,,
Forming the Relationship Between Views and Account Age The final research question is to analyze the relationship between the amount of views and the account age.,,,
It is reasonable to hypothesize that accounts with an older age receive more views as they have more time to build an audience and consistently upload videos.,,,
"Despite this data, it should also be noted that the model shown in the regression line is obviously not linear.",,,
There is no direct pattern that the data follows that would be able to provide an exact relationship between the account age and views variables.,,,
"However it is obvious that the cluster of plots between 0 and about 3B views have a large range of account age, starting at 25 weeks and going up to 692 weeks.",,,
This centralized area of plot points truly depict the variety that monetized channels contain regarding the tested variables.,,,
Discussion This analysis focused on the relationship between views and how factors such as country of origin and account age affect the number of views a YouTube channel receives on their videos.,,,
"Based on the findings, it was found that the United States has the greater number of views, globally, which is most likely due to the fact that they are the country with the most monetized channels globally.",,,
"While there is no direct relationship found between the account age and the amount of views a channel receives, it can be inferred that more modern creators receive greater views as they appeal to the younger generation.",,,
This particular hypothesis could be evinced if information regarding the age groups of the most consistent audience members as well as the channel creators was provided.,,,
"With this data, it could be statistically proved that younger creators are able to do better with monetization because they appeal more to the modern generations.",,,
"Overall, this analysis can help the public understand the analytical data regarding monetized YouTube channels and the potential factors that contribute to the success rate of these channels.",,,
