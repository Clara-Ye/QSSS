"Introduction: As the Earth continues to warm, forest fires are becoming increasingly relevant.",,,
"This past summer, wildfires tore through California; by the end of 2020, more than 4% of the state’s land had burned.",,,
"These forest fires pose a threat to residents, not only whose property may be destroyed by these fires, but also inhaling the smoke that comes from wildfires can have serious health effects as well.",,,
"Additionally, forest fires burn the carbon in trees and other vegetation, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, contributing to the heating of the Earth.",,,
"Ideally, this study will help authorities figure out what the warning signs of forest fires might be.",,,
This information will hopefully help identify what areas are most vulnerable and may soon experience forest fires.,,,
"Data: We have information on a set of 517 sample forest fires in Montesinho natural park, a region in the northeast of Portugal, given by Braganca Polytechnic Institute.",,,
"This data was collected from weather stations real time at the center of Montesinho natural park, between the years 2000 and 2003.",,,
"My main focus will be the area burned by the fire, a quantitative variable that measures the total area burned by the fire in hectacres (10,000 square meters).",,,
"As seen in the table above, the mean area burned was 12.895 hectacres while the median area burned was 0.520 hectacres, and the standard deviation of the area burned was 63.646 hectacres.",,,
"This indicates that there were a large number of lower area burns (less than 0.5 hectacres), and a few outliers that covered massive areas (hundreds or even over a thousand hectacres).",,,
The large standard deviation relative to the mean and median also indicates this.,,,
"In this report, I will be studying the day of the week, the month, and the Initial Spread Index (ISI), a score correlated to the fire velocity spread, and how much these variables correlate with the area burned.",,,
"ISI, had a mean of 9.022 and a standard deviation of 4.559.",,,
A scatter plot of ISI vs. area burned is shown below.,,,
"My first research question is, does the month of the forest fire correlate with the area burned?",,,
"My initial hypothesis is that the warmer months, May, June, July, August, and September, have more area burned per fire, due to higher temperatures in the summer.",,,
"Based on the figures above, the area burned appears to have a significant correlation with the month of the year, as the mean area burned in the warmer months, May, June, July, August, and September, have considerably higher average area burned than the other 7 months.",,,
"The mean number of hectacres burned per forest fire during these 5 warmer months was around 14.670, as opposed to a mean of about 6.060 hectacres burned per fire in the remaining months.",,,
"December however, contrary to my hypothesis, has a relatively high mean area burned, but this could be attributed to random error, as there were only 9 forest fires recorded in December, as opposed to the dozens or hundreds recorded in the warmer months.",,,
"We cannot draw a causal relationship, but because the mean number of hecatcres burned per fire in the warmer 5 months of the year is over 2.420 times larger than the mean number of hectacres burned per fire in the remaining 7 months, we can reasonably state that warmer months correlate to more area burned.",,,
"My second research question is, does the day of the week correlate with the area burned.",,,
"My initial hypothesis is that the day of the week won’t affect the area burned as with over 500 samples, day-to-day variances won’t have an effect on the data, and the day of the week should not affect the amount of area a fire burns.",,,
"Based on the figures above, there don’t seem to be any real patterns that can suggest that the day of the week has any relationship with the area burned.",,,
"While Saturdays had a considerably higher mean of around 25.584 hectacres burned, and Fridays had a considerably lower mean of around 5.311 hectacres burned, this is likely due to sampling error as there don’t seem to be any variables that could explain this difference.",,,
"My final research question is, is there a correlation between ISI and area burned?",,,
The ISI measurement is a relative measure of how quickly a fire can be expected to spread.,,,
"Because of this, my hypothesis is that the higher the ISI, the higher the mean number of hectacres burned will be.",,,
Discussion: The statistical analysis above focused on the area burned (in hectacres) for a sample of 517 forest fires from 2000 to 2003 in Montesinho natural park in Portugal.,,,
"In my analysis, I found that it can be reasonably inferred that the month of the year does correlate with the mean area burned, with warmer months correlating to more area burned, and cooler months correlating to less area burned (as expected).",,,
"Additionally, I found that the day of the week likely does not have a correlation with the mean area burned (as expected), and that variances are likely due to sampling errors.",,,
"Finally, I was surprised to find that there was not a strong correlation between the ISI and the area burned.",,,
This could be due to the smaller sample size as well as a possible systematic error in the study.,,,
"Forest fires from 2000 to 2003 in one small region of the world may not be accurately represent the whole population of forest fires, which could explain the lack of a strong correlation between ISI and the area burned.",,,
"My analysis provided reasonable evidence that the month of the year may correlate with the amount of expected burn, which can hopefully help authorities better prepare and predict when forest fires will be more severe.",,,
