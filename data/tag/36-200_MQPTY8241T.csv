"Introduction: As social media continues to become a major part of everyday life, YouTube is a platform that has been growing since 2005.",,,
"Now, YouTube provides a wide range of content for all ages and in all languages.",,,
"With YouTube being a very popular platform and Youtube becoming a job for many, subscriber count and number of views per video have been a point of concern for many creators.",,,
My goal is to find what people watch youtube for through subscribers and views.,,,
"Data: I have data on 1259 channels from 2005 to 2018, collected by Social Blade.",,,
"I will be mainly focusing on the variable, subscribers, which is a quantitative variable that shows the number of subscribers for every YouTube channel.",,,
The average number of subscribers per channel was 3201757.576 and the standard deviation was 3556605.298.,,,
Other variables that I will be examining will be views and category.,,,
The variable views is a quantitative variable listing the count of views each channel has gotten.,,,
The average number of views per channel was 1346843185.938 and the standard deviation was 2036809998.695.,,,
The variable category is a categorical variable stating which category each channel is under.,,,
"These categories include Comedy, Education, Entertainment, Film and Animation, Gaming, Lifestyle, Music, News&Politics, and Sports.",,,
Music and Entertainment are the most popular with an average of 1.61 billion and 1.41 billion views per channel respectfully.,,,
Characterizing the Distribution of Subscribers per Channel: My first research question will characterize the distribution of subscribers per YouTube channel.,,,
I hypothesize that most YouTube channels have around 500 thousand to 1 million subscribers.,,,
This hypothesis comes from anecdotal evidence from people who frequently use YouTube.,,,
"From the histogram showing subscriber count (figure 1 below), I observe that most YouTube channels have around 1-2 million subscribers.",,,
"This can be attributed to the difficulty and the amount of effort it takes to get exposed to millions of people and have a majority of them enjoy your content, thoroughly.",,,
"With more people on the platform, it would be interesting to see how the distribution of subscribers has changed from 2018 to 2021.",,,
"The distribution of subscribers per channel (figure 1) shows one primary mode 1 million to 1.5 million subscribers, and it is strongly right-skewed (tails off to the right).",,,
The histogram has a couple of major outliers at 21.5 million to 22 million and 27.5 million to 28 million.,,,
"The interquartile range for the number of subscribers per channel spans from 1,080,854 at the 25th percentile to 3,874,671 at the 75th percentile.",,,
"With 25% of channels having around 1 million subscribers, it further contradicts my hypothesis of most channels having less than 1,000,000 subscribers.",,,
"Also, there is around the same amount of a jump from the 25th percentile to the median and the jump from the median to the 75th percentile, showing how there is not a sudden increase to a higher subscriber count.",,,
Most channels stay within the same range and there are very few channels that can get to over 7 million subscribers.,,,
"Relationship between Subscriber Count and Number of Views My second research question is to investigate whether the number of subscribers a YouTube channel has is associated with the number of views a YouTube channel has, and to characterize the correlation if there is one.",,,
"When one subscribes to a YouTube channel, they do it so they can support the creator and because they do not want to miss any of that creator’s content.",,,
They receive notifications when the creator posts a new video and the creator’s content will show up on their recommended page and their subscription list.,,,
They will see that creator’s content pop up while they are surfing on YouTube.,,,
"Therefore, the likelihood of one watching content from a channel they are subscribed to is extremely high.",,,
"So it seems reasonable to suspect that the more subscribers a YouTube channel has, the more views a channel has.",,,
I made a scatter plot with the number of subscribers on the x-axis and the number of views on each channel on the y-axis.,,,
"Then, I added a linear line that best fits the trend of the points on the scatterplot.",,,
This is illustrated in figure 2.,,,
"From the regression computed above, I note that on average, for every one subscriber a channel gains, the channel gets 439.31 more views.",,,
"This shows that a channel is getting more views than they have subscribers, but there is a positive trend, therefore there is a correlation of having more views from more subscribers.",,,
"View Count Dependant on Category of Channel My third research question is to investigate whether or not the number of views a YouTube channel receives, is associated with the category the channel is under.",,,
"If there is an association, I will characterize it.",,,
"With the wide range of videos on YouTube, there are thousands of videos that fit under different types of categories to fit the interests of millions of viewers around the world.",,,
"If one viewer is interested in a category, YouTube recommends similar videos under the same category to the viewer.",,,
"Also, when one category is trending, even if the viewer does not watch that category, it will be recommended to them because other people are watching content from that category.",,,
"Therefore, I hypothesize that if one category is popular, the gap between the views that category will get compared to another is going to be apparent.",,,
I first found the average amount of views each channel receives based on category and the standard deviation.,,,
This information is summarized below in table 3.,,,
"From the table above, I can see that there is some variation in views based on the category channels are under.",,,
"For example, channels under Music and Entertainment are getting more views than channels under Lifestyle and Sports.",,,
I created side-by-side box plots to graphically investigate the relationship between the number of views and the category that a channel is under.,,,
This is shown in figure 3 below.,,,
"Overall, there does not seem to be a major difference between the categories in both the median and the average amount of views.",,,
"I cannot see a trend in one specific category being stronger than the others, so I can conclude that there is not a relationship between the category a channel is under and the views the channel gets.",,,
My analysis focused on the number of subscribers and number of views for a sample of 1259 channels from information during the time of 2005-2018.,,,
I examined relationships between subscribers and views along with the categories channels are under.,,,
"Overall, I found that the number of subscribers ranges from small channels with 10,000 subscribers to majorly big channels with 28 million subscribers.",,,
"Within this range, most channels have 1-3 million subscribers.",,,
"There was a relationship between the number of subscribers and the number of views, but it did seem that there were other factors in gaining views as it is highly unlikely that each subscriber watches each video over 400 times.",,,
It would be a nice research question to investigate what other factors play into the number of views a channel receives.,,,
There was no relationship between the number of views and which category channels are under.,,,
This analysis may become more precise if we divided the channels into more specific categories.,,,
My analysis can help people understand why subscribers are important to YouTube channels and what to (or what not to) focus on when trying to grow a channel.,,,
