Introduction: Health Insurance is something we all reach to have during the duration fo our lives.,,,
"However as we get older, the cost of health insurance becomes more of a mystery that is determined by age, medical history, and other lifestyle characteristics.",,,
"Heart disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States ( stated here https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm) , therefore people with hospital stays or complications related to heart disease tend to be high risk people that may have higher costs for health insurance.",,,
Our goal is to learn more about the relationship between medical history and specific characteristics of people looking to buy health insurance and their total cost of claims by the health insurance company.,,,
Dataset: We have information on 788 subscribers or people buying health insurance during the period of January 1998 through December 1999.,,,
"The primary focus will be on the cost of health insurance which is a quantitative variable measuring the amount fo money in dollars, an individual with heart disease is paying based on other influential factors.",,,
The mean cost on health insurance was $2799.96 with a standard deviation of $6690.26.,,,
"Our research questions, which you will find in research scenarios below, will also include the variables: number of comorbidities and the duration of treatment condition.",,,
Comorbidities is another way of saying the number of other diseases a person had and this is a quantitative variable.,,,
The mean comorbidities was 3.76 other diseases with a standard deviation of 5.95 other diseases.,,,
The duration of treatment condition is measured by the amount of days a person is treated for a condition and is again a quantitative variable.,,,
The mean duration was 164 days with a standard deviation of 120.9 days.,,,
Distribution of Health Insurance Cost The first question will be to interpret the distribution of health insurance cost.,,,
We hypothesize that most health insurance costs will be below ( <$500) five hundred dollars.,,,
"Observation/ Description: Based on the histogram above ( Figure 1), we can observe that most health insurance cost is less than $499.",,,
"The distribution of cost is unimodal, there is one mode or general cluster.",,,
"The data is not symmetric, it is skewed to the right with a long right tail.",,,
"There are potential outliers seen from right above 10k up to almost 55k, we can see a closer look in figure 2.",,,
"Some specific examples are around 20k, 25k and 41k but there are others.",,,
"Conclusion: Looking at the distribution of health insurance cost, the mean cost was $2799.96 with a standard deviation relative to the mean of $6690.26 but the median cost for health insurance was $507.20.",,,
It is important to therefore note that around half of the people who were buying health insurance were paying less than (<$500) five hundred dollars.,,,
"Based on this conclusion, we can say that our initial hypothesis that most health insurance costs will be below ( <$500) five hundred dollars is supported by the data.",,,
"From this available summary table above (table 1), we can can bring up future research questions based on some conclusions we can draw up.",,,
"The interquartile range is between the first quartile ($161) and the third( $1925), it represents from 25%- 75% of data.",,,
The range in cost between this interquartile range of data is small compared to the overall range of cost.,,,
This could lead to further questions or research about what factors or variables are creating such a jump in cost in just 25% of the data.,,,
Our next research question is to look into whether there is an association between the cost in health insurance and comorbidities or more specifically the number of other diseases a person had.,,,
Health insurance is determined by many factors.,,,
"Since a higher comorbidity someone has means more diseases, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that there would be a positive association between the cost of health insurance and the amount of diseases a person had.",,,
(e.g.,,,
"someone with a higher comorbidity could lead to more ER visits or a longer duration of treatment) Observation/Description: In figure 3 above, we plot the cost of health care with number of comorbidities which you can see on the axis.",,,
"Just looking at the points we see many of the points are clustered in the left hand corner and as cost increases, some points start to break away from this cluster and become more spread out.",,,
"Overall, there is a right-skewness evident on the plot.",,,
There are some outlying points such as the two that are between the range of 0-10k and are above 40 comorbidities.,,,
"The linear fit line is shown above and based on observation, is going up in a positive direction.",,,
"Conclusion: Looking at the data between the cost of health insurance and the number of other diseases these people have, the linear fit line is in a positive direction and so are the data points themselves.",,,
"Based on this conclusion, we can say that our initial hypothesis of there being a positive association between the cost of health insurance and the amount of diseases a person had is supported but the data.",,,
"If your health insurance cost is higher, you are more likely to have a higher comorbidites or have more diseases.",,,
"Based on the table above (table 2), we can confirm that the linear fit line is going in a positive direction.",,,
"The equation for this line is 3.4 + 0.0001x , even taking in consideration on standard deviation, our slope for the linear fit line is positive.",,,
"Based on table 3 above, we can also get a better understanding on the data points themselves and whether they show an association between the two variables.",,,
There is a 0.146 correlation between the cost in health insurance and the number of comorbidities.,,,
In terms of correlation this means there is small positive correlation between the variables.,,,
Our third research question is to investigate whether there is an association between comorbidity or the number of other diseases someone has and duration of treatment in terms of the amount of days.,,,
"Based on our last research question, we know that there is a positive association between the cost of health insurance and comorbities.",,,
"Due to this proven association, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that there would also be a positive association between comorbidity and duration of treatment.",,,
(e.g.,,,
someone with a higher comorbidity could lead to needing a longer amount of treatment.),,,
Based on just looking at the plotted points we can see that there is a clear upward direction as comorbidity increases.,,,
The majority of the points are right above and below each other because we plotted comorbidities on the x axis.,,,
However we made this choice because we wanted to look at the duration of treatment based on comorbidities.,,,
"There are some outlying points, we see two very distinct outliers that are above 40 comorbidities.",,,
"The linear fit line is shown above and based on observation, is going up in a positive direction.",,,
"Conclusion: Looking at the data between comorbidities and duration of treatment, the linear fit line is in a positive direction and so are nearly all the data points.",,,
"Based on these observations, we can conclude that our initial hypothesis of there being a positive association between comorbidities and duration is supported by the data.",,,
"If someone has more diseases or a higher comorbidity, you are more likely to have had a longer period or duration of treatment.",,,
"Based on table 4 above, we can confirm that the linear fit line is going in a positive direction.",,,
"The equation for this linear fit line is 126.1 + 10.1x, even taking in consideration on standard deviation, our slope for the linear fit line is positive.",,,
"Based on table 5 above, we can also get a better understanding on the data points themselves and whether they show an association between the two variables.",,,
There is a 0.495 correlation between comorbidities and duration.,,,
In terms of correlation this means there is a significant positive correlation between the variables.,,,
Discussion: Our analysis focused on the cost of health insurance for a sample of 788 subscribers while looking at the connections between comorbidity.,,,
We also focused on then connecting comorbidity with duration of treatment time.,,,
"Overall, we found that cost of health insurance was less than $500, almost 50% of the time.",,,
We saw a small positive association between the cost of health insurance and the amount of diseases a person had but a stronger association between comorbidities and duration of treatment someone had.,,,
Future analysis might include associating the cost of health insurance and duration of treatment time or even seeing if there is a casual relationship between the variables we looked at.,,,
We may look into what has changed between the time this data was collected in 1998-1999 since it seems plausible that there might be a change in cost of health insurance in present time.,,,
Overall our research gives some good information on the relationship between medical history like duration of treatment or the number of diseases one has and the total cost of claims by the health insurance company.,,,
