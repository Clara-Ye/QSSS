Introduction YouTube is the largest platform for video entertainment.,,,
"Content creators are generating more views every month, with 100 million unique viewers a month now as mentioned by (https://www.business-standard.com/article/technology/youtube-growing-fast-shorts-gets-3-5-bn-daily-views-sundar-pichai-121020300330_1.html).",,,
The incredible success of content creators raises the question: what exactly makes a YouTuber successful?,,,
"In this paper, we define success as how many views a YouTuber gets per video.",,,
"We observe how success relates to important parts of being a YouTuber, like subscriber count and content type.",,,
Rising content creators may find our findings helpful in growing their channels and seeing if content creation in the right career path for them.,,,
"Data In this paper, we utilize data from 1259 YouTube channels collected in 2018 by social analytics company SocialBlade.",,,
The main variable we observe is views/video.,,,
"It is quantitative and its mean is 2,960,682.062.",,,
"To have a concrete definition of success, we define any channel accruing views/video at or above the mean as successful and any channel performing otherwise as unsuccessful.",,,
We observe research scenarios in the next section.,,,
"In research scenario 1, we observe video category, which indicates what topic (Sports, Music, etc) a channel covers.",,,
"With no help from its name, we define video category as a categorical variable.",,,
The most common video category is Entertainment with 517 associated channels and the least common is Sports with 23 associated channels.,,,
"In research scenarios 2 and 3, we observe subscriber count, which measures how many subscribers a YouTuber has.",,,
Subscriber count is a quantitative variable and its mean is 3201757.576 and median is 1949612.000.,,,
All mentioned variables help us form an analysis on how success is impacted by different aspects of a YouTube channel.,,,
Research Scenarios We aim to answer the question: is what category a YouTuber creates content for a significant factor in their success?,,,
"Off personal experience, YouTube is largely used as an entertainment platform used to relax after a work day rather than an educational or any other platform.",,,
"So, most users will contribute views to entertainment channels and give them success over any other category of YouTube channel.",,,
We can visualize views/video (success) against category via a bar graph whose horizontal axis is categories and y axis is average views/video.,,,
Further summary of the data shows us which categories can be deemed successful and other important details.,,,
Remember that mean views/video is 2.960682M.,,,
"At/above average categories include Comedy, Education, and Music, thus these are the categories at which YouTubers are most successful.",,,
"News/Politics, Gaming, Sports, Entertainment, Animation, and Lifestyle all average as unsuccessful.",,,
"Additional summary observes a standard deviation of 7,289,283.966 in views/video in the most successful category, and one of 320,558.759 in the least, news/politics.",,,
"Top categories similarly exhibit higher standard deviation than the less popular categories, with an average standard deviation of 10,031,545.4253 among top 3 categories and 2,315,775.64483.",,,
The difference in standard deviation suggests channels that are successful have highly varying degrees of success (views/video) while unsuccessful channels have similarly poor success (views/video).,,,
The data disproves our hypothesis that entertainment is the most success accruing category to create content for.,,,
"However, the question of “why” still remains.",,,
We can attempt to answer why with our following research questions.,,,
"We’ve disproven our hypothesis that Entertainment is the most successful category to create content for, and it’s rather Music.",,,
"We observe another variable, subscriber count, to see if that is a correlating factor in views/video and why Music is the most successful category.",,,
"Here, we aim to answer the question: is subscriber count proportional to a YouTuber’s views/video?",,,
It’s reasonable to infer that a YouTuber with many views also has many subscribers so that viewers may be notified and have a customized feed of that Youtuber’s videos.,,,
"Thus, the entertainment category, which has the YouTubers with the most viewers, should have the most subscribers.",,,
We can visualize the percentage of all YouTube subscribers relative to video categories with a pie chart.,,,
"The median of all subscribers is 1.949612M, the lower quartile is 1.080841M and the upper quartile is 3.880515M.",,,
The distance between the lower and median is only 0.868771M and the difference between the upper and median is 1.930903M and the entire range of the data is 2.7658094M.,,,
"Entertainment, Music, Gaming, and Lifestyle channels (channels in the 75th percentile) have many more subscribers than do the channels in the 25th percentile.",,,
"Perhaps channels in the 75th percentile have strong, individual personalities that people subscribe² to.",,,
"Channels in the 25th percentile may have more generic, quick videos that people have interest in, but don’t have YouTubers people subscribe to because they’re more generic, quick videos.",,,
"E.g., Education videos have very high views/videos, but people generally aren’t attracted to specific personalities in the category since education doesn’t really have personality to it, it’s an objective category.",,,
We can go further into the relationship between subscribers and views/video by looking into means.,,,
"While the most subscribed to category is Entertainment, it happens to have a lower mean of 3.123684M than lesser subscribed to categories.",,,
"E.g., Gaming has a higher mean of 3.594056M.",,,
"Gaming channels tend to have unique personalities tied to them, which is why views choose to view one YouTube playing the same exact game versus another YouTuber.",,,
"Entertainment tends to have many different celebrities, athletes, etc.",,,
"interacting with one another, creating a mush of content without distinctive personalities.",,,
The difference between Entertainment subscriber count mean and Gaming subscriber count mean and our inference about personalities suggests that subscriber count is correlated with the “strength” of a personality.,,,
"Higher views/video are positively proportional to subscriber count as well, but personality is very subjective and can be hard to quantify.",,,
The data disproves our hypothesis that the channel with the most views should also have the most subscribers.,,,
"We can go one step deeper into the relationship between subscribers and views/video by looking at their correlation coefficients, an exact measure of the “correlation” we’ve been seeking out throughout this paper.",,,
We’ve disproven our hypotheses that Entertainment is the most successful category to produce content for and that having a high views/video ratio implies a high subscriber count.,,,
"Our final scenario aims to connect the bridge between success (views/video), subscriber count, and lurking variables.",,,
I bring up lurking variables because of our earlier discussion of “personality’ and how subscriber count is correlated to that undocumented variable.,,,
"We now explore the idea of the many lurking variables that affect the correlation between views/video and There are many hard to quantify/categorize variables like personality and viral-”ness” that make the correlation between success and subscriber count weak, i.e., <0.7.",,,
We may observe the table listing the correlation coefficients between views/video and subscribers.,,,
"The correlation between overall views/video and subscribers is 0.135, with notable correlations within categories being Entertainment with 0.256, Education with 0.515, Gaming with 0.450, and Comedy with 0.516.",,,
"Among all correlations, overall included, the correlations are weak, <0.7.",,,
We can also observe the graphical representation of the overall correlation between views/video and subscriber count.,,,
"Our hypothesis is proven correct, there’s low correlation coefficient between views/video, which leads us to believe that there’s lurking variables.",,,
We deep dove into the very subjective idea of “personality” where personality-driven channels like Gaming and Lifestyle gain their subscriber count from personality but still have lower views than Entertainment.,,,
"We should also discuss another lurking and hard to define variable, viralness.",,,
"Crazy stunts or celebrity gossip often becomes “viral”, accruing extreme amounts of views in short amounts of time.",,,
"However, no one is going to subscribe to a fad.",,,
"Viral videos are fads that catch viewers attention for a short amount of time, but don’t keep viewers hooked for long enough on something persistent like a personality to stay, to subscribe² to a YouTuber.",,,
Subjective ideas like personality and viralness weaken the correlation between subscriber count and views/video and attribute views/video more to these subjective ideas.,,,
"Getting back to the numbers, we observe that average mean of views/video is 2.960682M and median views/video is 1.030668M.",,,
"Since the median is less than the mean, the graph of views/video is skewed right, and by quite a margin (mean - median = 1930013.965.",,,
The skewness of the data shows us that there’s data points with extremely high views/video increasing the mean to be far from the median/”middle” of views/video ratios.,,,
"These data points can be explained by our viralness idea, where they have extremely high views because of a fad but aren’t consistent with the center/median of the data.",,,
"Hard to measure variables like personality and viralness make the correlation coefficient weak between views/video and subscriber count, proving our final hypothesis right, but more importantly, that views/video is highly affected by multiple variables and not just proportional with one another defined/known variable.",,,
"Discussion We’re able to make ideas like success tangible by assigning a ratio to already tangible variables, like videos and views.",,,
"However, once we create a new variable like success, we create a whole new world of correlation and associated variables.",,,
We used the dataset of YouTube channels and related statistics provided by SocialBlade in 2018 to analyze success (as we defined it).,,,
"We saw a proportional relationship between views/video and subscriber count, but the correlation was weak, with r = 0.135.",,,
"Our real discovery was the idea of subjective, lurking variables.",,,
Personality behind a YouTube channel attribute to high subscriber counts and quick bursts of viralness attribute to high views/video.,,,
"We couldn’t quantify/categorize these lurking variables because of how subjective/random they can be, but they’re still definitely factors in the success of a YouTube channel.",,,
People looking to pursue YouTube as a passion or career can use these facts to decide if hoping for a viral video or producing consistent content true to their personalities are methods they are okay with utilizing to do so.,,,
