"Introduction: Being in the most valuable position in all of American team sports, a National Football League quarterback faces unparalleled scrutiny for their performance as the team’s success hinges on their ability to overcome any presented obstacle.",,,
"Due to this fact, franchise owners, the eventual rule brokers, feel a disproportionate obligation to protect their quarterback from contact in order to avoid the risk of injury (as stipulated by ESPN, Nov. 20, 2013: https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/10007640/nfl-overprotects-quarterbacks-good-reason) .",,,
"With the ideal quarterback shifting towards the mobile, athletic, yet still cerebral prototype, (according to the Boston Globe, Nov. 25, 2020: https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/11/25/sports/cam-newton-likes-what-he-sees-latest-generation-mobile-qbs-including-kyler-murray/) it begs the question: should avoiding contact remain one of the most significant priorities for NFL front offices.",,,
The goal of the current work is to better comprehend the concept of quarterback contact as it may help pro football general managers and owners best allocate resources in a salary-cap-driven league.,,,
"Additionally, any player at hand will be referred to as the ‘quarterback’ as that is the position that is involved on the passing side of the play with an overwhelming majority.",,,
Data: The data set consists of each passing performance of National Football League players from 2009 until week 17 (the final week of the regular season) of the 2018 season as collected by Ron Yurko as part of his nflscrapR package.,,,
This results in 3768 quarterbacks being evaluated.,,,
"Primarily, the variable of Total EPA (Expected Points Added) is the quantitative variable that will be the subject of this exploratory data analysis.",,,
This is an accumulation of the difference of Expected Points for each pass attempt before and after a play for a given player during a given game.,,,
"Essentially, this is a measure of a player’s impact during a play on the score of a game.",,,
"As this measure of Total EPA relies solely on the pass attempts a given player is involved in, this metric seems to be especially well suited to measure quarterback performance.",,,
The mean total EPA is 6.269 points with a standard deviation of 9.687 points.,,,
The research questions in the following section will contain Times Hit and TD to Interception Ratio.,,,
"Times hit is a categorical variable indicative of the total number of times the quarterback is hit or knocked down during a given game, both during pass plays and otherwise.",,,
The TD to interception ratio is a quantitative variable that refers to how many touchdown passes a quarterback has in proportion to the amount of interceptions for that game.,,,
All variables are seen in more detail in Table 1 below.,,,
Analyzing the Distribution of Total EPA: The first question is determining what the distribution of the variable of Total EPA is and characterizing it according to that distribution.,,,
"By the current understanding of quarterback performance while accounting for the parity of the NFL due to the salary, it can be hypothesized that most Total EPA evaluations will lie between -6 to 6 as that is the range of scoring one touchdown for one’s own team and one for the opponent.",,,
"Employing the histogram approach (as seen in Figure 1 below) to visualize the distribution of Total EPA, a unimodal symmetric distribution, with a singular peak in the 5 - 5.999 bin, becomes immediately apparent.",,,
"From this, it can be supposed that, due to a quarterback’s own preparation and talent, they tend to avoid negative points added to their team.",,,
"In other words, at the professional level, they are not consistently a detriment to their team.",,,
"Additionally, due to opposing defenses working to prevent offensive explosions through diligent fim study and deployment of defensive talent, these quarterbacks’ Total EPA does not tend to stray far beyond 6 points or one touchdown scored for their own team.",,,
"To further summarize the distribution of Total EPA, it is essential to compare the mean of 6.269 points to the standard deviation of 9.687 which is unusually high in comparison to the median about 6 points.",,,
"As the interquartile range for Total EPA goes from 0.251 points to 12.780 points with a range of 12.529 points and a significant portion of the 25% - 50% range of the data lies within the hypothesized area, it can be seen that many quarterbacks score Total EPAs within the hypothesized range.",,,
"In addition, the median Total EPA is 6.427 points, which partially reaffirms the hypothesis that a quarterback’s estimated points added accumulates to about one touchdown (in this case for their own team).",,,
"The next research question is concerning the dependence of total EPA on the times a quarterback is hit, and to identify the association between the two if there is one.",,,
"Due to the fact that repeated hits on the quarterback are a result of the combination of a weak offensive line and good defensive line along with receivers being consistently covered by defensive coverage, it is reasonable to hypothesize that as a quarterback is hit more times, the cumulative points they contribute to the team for that game will be decreased to a correlated extent.",,,
"Through this, it is possible to graphically view the relationship between the two variables through the employment of side-by-side box plots in Figure 2: The box plots, analyzed through both their relative medians and interquartile ranges, confirm the pre-established hypothesis for this question.",,,
"Specifically with the medians, it is apparent that they decrease gradually as the number of total hits for a game increases from 0 to 13.",,,
"This is transferable to the interquartile ranges to some extent as the majority of each category would summarily fall in terms of Total EPA as the number of hits increase, with distinct drops at the 8 and 11 hits points.",,,
"Additionally, outliers are noticeable when there were 0 to 3 hits, which does not seem to affect the trend as it remains inversely proportional.",,,
"Altogether, it becomes clear that there is an inverse relationship between total EPA and times hit for the quarterback’s performance, reinforcing the hypothesis and proving that it may be important to consider investing in quarterback protection to improve performance and eventually the franchise’s financial and overall well being.",,,
"With the sufficient variation in the box plots in the general downward direction, there is enough evidence to confirm a relationship.",,,
The final research question is in regards to the potential relationship between the Touchdown to Interception Ratio and Total EPA.,,,
"According to the fact that a value of a quarterback can essentially be simplified to understanding how much they score versus how many opportunities they provide opponents with (through turnovers, most commonly interceptions), it seems that it is reasonable to hypothesize that quarterbacks with higher (better) ratios will yield a positive relationship with total EPA.",,,
"Taking into account the 1670 data points that are discounted for this question due the fact that sometimes quarterbacks did not throw any interceptions, Table 2 shows the regression model of the ratio on total EPA.",,,
This is in addition to the actual graphical representation as a scatter plot of the points concerning both variables along with the attached regression line in Figure 3.,,,
"As there is a distinct regression line through the scatter plot with a generally positive slope, it can be reasonably assumed that there is a positive relationship between the two variables.",,,
"Discussion: As the analysis was derived from the data collected from the 3768 quarterback performances, from 2009 to week 17 of 2018, with a focus on Total EPA, Times Hit, and Touchdown to Interception Ratio, it was found that Total EPA has a unimodal symmetrical distribution, centered at 6.427 points.",,,
"Additionally, it was discovered that there was a strong inverse relationship between Total EPA and Times Hit due to the detrimental effects of being hit on quarterback performance.",,,
"Finally, the analysis assisted in confirming that there is a direct relationship between a quarterback’s touchdown to interception ratio and their Total EPA as they both are relative performance indicators, hence driven by related factors.",,,
"In totality, this analysis is beneficial to both quarterbacks and general managers who are deciding how to evaluate quarterback performance in terms of how much stock they should put into offensive line (protection) support and other offensive support of the such for their quarterbacks.",,,
This can possibly help in shedding light onto the still existing issue when a quarterback is excessively pressured.,,,
