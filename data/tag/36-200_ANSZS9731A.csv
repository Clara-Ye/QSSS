"Especially in the world that we live in today consisting of growing problems with climate change, it’s imperative that we understand the impacts that humans have on the environment.",,,
"And within recent times, the natural disaster that has shook up not just the United States, but also the world, has been forest fires.",,,
"Even just within the past year, we saw the California wildfires turn nearly the entire west coast upside down (as reported by Mercury News, February 28, 2021 https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/02/28/editorial-california-must-pass-emergency-wildfire-prevention-funding/).",,,
And it’s because of this exact reason why we need to analyze the forest fires weather index - so we can make better environmental decisions that will positively impact the world we live in.,,,
The data collected consists of 517 different forest fires and their respective Fire Weather Index.,,,
"Throughout this report, we will primarily focus on the quantitative components of the Fire Weather Index which is comprised of the Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC), Duff Moisture Code (DMC), Drought Code (DC) and Initial Spread Index (ISI).",,,
Our research questions will primarily be focused on the quantitative variable Duff Moisture Code (DMC) and it’s relationship with DC (Drought Code).,,,
The mean for DMC is 110.,,,
"DMC is the moisture content of deep and shallow organic layers, and the mean DMC out of the 517 forest fires studied was 110.872.",,,
"The month with the highest median for DMC was August, with a median DMC of 145.4, and a max DMC of 273.8.",,,
"DC (Drought Code) is a quantitative variable similar to the measure of DC, except it doesn’t take humidity into account.",,,
"In this study with 517 forest fires, the mean DC was 547.94 and the standard deviation is 248.066.",,,
Our first question is going to analyze the distribution of DMC.,,,
"In order to best look at the shape, center, and spread of the data for DMC, I’ve created a histogram with the given data so that it’s easier to visualize.",,,
"First, let’s analyze the shape.",,,
"When we look at the shape of this histogram, we can see that the data is bimodal, meaning that there are two “peaks” in the data.",,,
We can also see that the data is skewed right because there is a tail of gradually decreasing data points as the DMC gets higher.,,,
"From this, we can infer that the mean (110.872) is slightly higher than the median for this data (108.300).",,,
"As for the center, one of the best ways to measure central tendencies would be to use the mean.",,,
The mean of this data as previously mentioned is 110.872.,,,
"Finally, if we analyze the spread of the distribution, we can see that the DMC ranges from a DMC of 1.1 all the way to 291.3.",,,
"In addition, another way to analyze spread would be standard deviation, which in this case, is 64.046.",,,
This is on average how far the data tends to stray away from the mean.,,,
"Overall, there are no outliers in this distribution that would skew the data one way or another.",,,
"We can hypothesize that the average DMC is pretty high, considering that the mean is above 100.",,,
Our second question is going to be analyzing the DMC per month.,,,
"In order to best do this, we are going to use a box plot so that we can compare the breakdowns side by side.",,,
"Looking at the data, we can see that on average, August is the month that has the highest DMC.",,,
This is because the line in the middle of each box plot representing the median has the largest value for August compared to any other month.,,,
"The median for August is 145.4, which is 23% higher than the second-largest median in September which is 117.9.",,,
"In addition, August has the largest interquartile range with a DMC value of 70.1.",,,
"While we can see that the month of August has the max value for DMC of 273.8, we have to look at the outliers from other months which have surpassed that value.",,,
"For example, September has a DMC value that is an outlier of roughly 291.3, which is 17.5 units higher than the max DMC value for August.",,,
"Overall, we can see that on average, the DMC value in forest fires is higher during months when the temperature is warmer, compared to the months where the temperature is colder.",,,
"Because the IQR for the summer months is reasonably greater than the IQR for the colder months, there may be a moderate association between temperature and the moisture content (including humidity) value.",,,
"If we dive into it further, these two variables have a correlation coefficient of .47, signaling a moderately strong, positive correlation.",,,
Our third and final question is going to be characterizing the relationship between DMC and DC.,,,
"As mentioned before, DC (Drought Code) is a similar measure to DMC, but without taking humidity into account.",,,
"Since DMC and DC are relatively similar measures, it can be easy to assume that their relationship is going to have a moderate to strong relationship, as categorized by the R value.",,,
"And when we actually look at the scatterplot, we can see that there is definitely a positive, linear correlation between DMC and DC.",,,
"Knowing this, we can hypothesize that the higher the moisture content including humidity, the moisture content of deep or shallow organic layers tends to increase as well.",,,
"The correlation between these two variables can be quantified with an R value of 0.682, signaling that their relationship is somewhat strong.",,,
Drawing a line of best fit can also help us see how strong the relationship is between these two variables.,,,
The line of best fit has an intercept of 254.99 and a coefficient of 2.64.,,,
This would mean that the equation of the line to predict what the DC would be at a certain level of DMC (or vice-versa) would be ŷ = 254.99 + 2.64x.,,,
"This would mean that for every unit of DMC, the moisture content excluding humidity would increase by 2.64.",,,
"Overall, our report focused on the Duff Moisture Content and analyzed it’s relationship with other variables like temperature and the Drought Code.",,,
"First, we saw that the distribution of moisture content (including humidity) was far from perfect; the distribution was bimodal and skewed right, signaling that the mean moisture content was higher than the median moisture content.",,,
"Second, we analyzed the breakdown of DMC by month.",,,
"In doing this, we saw that during the warmer months, specifically August with a median DMC of 145.4, the moisture content was higher than the winter months, because we looked at the median of each respective box plot.",,,
"And finally, we analyzed the correlation between DMC and DC.",,,
"We knew that these two variables are very similar for measuring moisture content, so it was reasonable to assume there would be a correlation.",,,
"As it turns out, they had a positive, linear, and moderately strong correlation, as quantified by the R value of .682.",,,
"However, we must realize that there are constraints to these conclusions.",,,
There were only 517 forest fires utilized within this study.,,,
We don’t know whether other previous forest fires have data that could drastically disprove our hypotheses or conclusions.,,,
"In addition, we also don’t know if there is a lurking variable that can explain why DMC is higher in the summer months compared to the winter months.",,,
"If we want to further explore the possibility of a lurking variable, we would need more data from other forest fires.",,,
"In analyzing the Duff Moisture Content within forest fires in this study and its interactions between other variables, we hope that scientists, environmentalists, and other trained professionals can find a way to mitigate forest fires so that humanity can live in a safer world.",,,
