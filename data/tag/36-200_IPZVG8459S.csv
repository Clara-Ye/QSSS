"Introduction: Forest fires cause environmental, ecological, and economic damage.",,,
"Our goal is to find patterns and relationships between elements of weather (temperature, wind, rain) and the severity/occurrences of forest fires (measured in total burned area and count).",,,
"In September 2020, National Geographic published an article verifying climate change’s effect on wildfires (https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/climate-change-increases-risk-fires-western-us) Establishing patterns will allow officials to detect signs of an oncoming fire and will hopefully allow them to prepare.",,,
"Data: From 2000 to 20003, the park inspector and the Braganca polytechnic Institute in Portugal recorded sample data from 517 forest fires in Montesinho natural park.",,,
"The data they collected includes quantitative values for area, temperature, Fine Fuel Moisture Code, Drought Code, Duff Moisture Code, and Initial Spread Index.",,,
The primary focus of this analysis will be on the variable temperature.,,,
Temperature is the quantitative measure in degrees Celsius during the 30-minute time period of the fire.,,,
"We will also be analyzing the variables, month and area and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC).",,,
Month is a categorical variable that represents the months of the year.,,,
Area is a quantitative variable that represents the total burned area measured in hectares (ha).,,,
The mean total burned area was 12.895.,,,
FFMC is the moisture content of surface litter in the forest.,,,
For the first question we will explore how the forest fires are distributed throughout the year.,,,
"Knowing that areas in the northern hemisphere experience warm weather during the summer (June-September), we can hypothesize that there were more forest fires during these months.",,,
This histogram shows the distribution of forest fires over the months of the year.,,,
The month of August had the most forest fires (184) and September had the second highest amount of forest fires (172).,,,
The second question will be to characterize the distribution of temperature throughout the year.,,,
"We hypothesized in the first question that more fires occurred in June, July, and August.",,,
"In this second question, we hypothesize that higher temperatures will happen in June, July, August, and September.",,,
"Based on the distribution of total forest fires throughout the year, we can predict that temperatures will be higher in August and September knowing that more forest fires occur in August and September.",,,
Here we will actually look at the data to see if temperatures were truly higher in those months.,,,
The third question will be to ask whether there was a relationship between temperature and FFMC.,,,
FFMC is the moisture content of surface litter.,,,
High FFMC values usually suggest more severe burning conditions.,,,
"We hypothesize that there will be a relationship between the two, because warm temperatures may decrease moisture levels.",,,
"There is a positive correlation between temperature and FFMC, illustrated in Figure 4.",,,
"According to the Baganca Institute that collected the meteorologic data, high values of FFMC suggest more severe burn conditions.",,,
We will calculate the average total burned area (Mean area) and group them by month to see if there is a correlation between the warmer months (therefore higher FFMC) and total area burned.,,,
"From this table, we organize the mean total burned area by month.",,,
In August there were an average of 12.535 total hectares burned during 184 total forest fires.,,,
In September there were an average of 17.986 total hectares burned during the 172 total forest fires.,,,
"Since more area was burned in the summer months, we can postulate that this is because of the increased temperature and high FFMC values.",,,
"This confirms the correlation between high FFMC and severe burning conditions, but does not necessarily prove causation between the two.",,,
Discussion: Our analysis focused on forest fires based on data from Montesinho natural park in Portugal.,,,
"Our primary variable of focus was temperature, and we considered its relationships with month and Fine Fuel Moisture Code.",,,
Our first question was to analyze the distribution of forest fires per month of the year.,,,
"Overall, we found that most forest fires occur in August and September.",,,
We hypothesized that this was due to the higher temperatures typically experienced at that time of the year in the northern hemisphere.,,,
"To explore more, we also characterized the distribution of forest fires throughout the year and throughout the week.",,,
"Most forest fires throughout the year, and especially in the summer, happened on a Friday, Saturday, or Sunday.",,,
The second question was to analyze the distribution of temperature throughout the year.,,,
"We predicted that temperatures would be higher in the months August and September than any other month, because more forest fires occurred in those months.",,,
"Our data shows that the median temperatures for June, July, August, and September were higher than the other months.",,,
"The month of August had significant outliers, but the data still aligns with our hypothesis.",,,
The third question was establishing a relationship between temperature and FFMC.,,,
"When graphed on a scatterplot, the data exhibited a positive, linear relationship between temperature and FFMC.",,,
The higher the temperature the higher the FFMC value.,,,
We provide a table of values that lists the mean area of damage grouped by months.,,,
"As predicted, more damage is recorded in the summer months—those with higher temperatures and therefore higher FFMC values.",,,
This verifies the park inspectors claim that high FFMC values suggest more severe burns.,,,
One issue with the data representation is in Figure 4.,,,
Temperature Given Month.,,,
The amount of outlier temperatures in August should be investigated further.,,,
"For the purpose of exploratory data analysis, it might have been better to represent the average temperatures per month instead of the median temperatures.",,,
These results will help the park to be more prepared for the summer months.,,,
Knowing potential indicators (like temperature and FMC) will allow the parks to evacuate people sooner and take precautionary measures (like clearing forest debris or limiting campfires).,,,
Future analyses might include population of visitors as well.,,,
We briefly examined the distribution of fires during the week.,,,
Knowing when the parks are busiest throughout the summer season will help rangers ensure the safety of all visitors.,,,
