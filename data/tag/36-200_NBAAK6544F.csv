"Introduction Forest fires can result in great economic and ecological damage, as well as loss of human life.",,,
"In particular, Portugal is especially susceptible to forest fires because large areas of land in central and northern Portugal have been turned into eucalyptus plantations.",,,
"Although the plantations supply Portugal with the raw material needed to sustain the pulp industry, eucalyptus is highly combustible.",,,
"From 1980 to 2005, more than 2.7 million hectares of forest was burned.",,,
"Furthermore, 4.6% and 3.1% of Portugal was destroyed in 2003 and 2005 respectively.",,,
Both fires resulted in around 20 human deaths.,,,
"The situation has not improved in recent years, with 30,000 hectares of forest burned, 250 people injured and 64 people killed in the 2017 Pedrógão Grande.",,,
"Hence, early detection of areas prone to forest fires is crucial for forest preservation and saving lives.",,,
"Fast and accurate detection allows for preparations to be made and resources deployed in a timely manner, reducing the severity and extent of impact.",,,
"In this study, we examine the factors that may help predict the the total burned area of forest fires using data from the Montesinho natural park in the northeast region of Portugal.",,,
"Given the rich floral and fauna diversity in Montesinho, this work may aid in fire detection and forest preservation efforts in Montesinho.",,,
"Dataset We have information on 517 forest fires in the Montesinho natural park, located in the northeast region of Portugal.",,,
The meteorological information was collected within 30 minutes of the fire occurrence by a station run by the Braganca Polytechnic Institute.,,,
The station is located in the center of the Montesinho park.,,,
The rest of the data was recorded by the inspector at Montesinho.,,,
The data was collected from January 2000 to December 2003.,,,
"Our main focus in this report would be the variable, total burned area.",,,
"For all of our analysis in this report, we are using a filtered dataset that omits outliers in the data that have values above 100 ha, which reduces the size of our dataset to 506.",,,
Total burned area is a quantitative variable that measures how much area was burned by the forest fire in hectares (ha).,,,
The mean total burned area was 6.36 ha while the standard deviation was 13.80 ha.,,,
We first characterize the distribution of total burned area using a histogram in Fig.,,,
1.,,,
From Fig.,,,
"1, we observe that most of the forest fires burned an area below 5.09 ha.",,,
"We postulate that this could be a result of good fire management strategies, that kept the spread of the fire to a minimum.",,,
"The distribution of total burned area is unimodal, with the mode between 0.10 to 5.09.",,,
"It is also very strongly skewed to the right, with several potential outliers around 70, 80 and 100 ha.",,,
"Our research questions will also involve the season, wind speed and Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC).",,,
"The variable, season, is a categorical season that combines certain months in the year, as detailed in Table 1.",,,
The creation of the new variable season was done with consideration for the temperature changes during the different months of the year.,,,
Season indicates the season during which the forest fire occurred.,,,
"December, January, February From Fig.",,,
"2, we observe that Summer was the season with the greatest occurrence of forest fires.",,,
"228 forest fires occurred in Summer, which comprises 45.1% of forest fires in the dataset.",,,
"Winter was the season with the lowest occurrence of forest fires, with only 6.1% of forest fires occurring then.",,,
Wind speed is a quantitative variable that measures outside wind speed in km/h.,,,
The mean wind speed is 4.03 km/h and the standard deviation is 1.80 km/h.,,,
The distribution of wind speed can be examined via the histogram in Fig.,,,
3.,,,
From Fig.,,,
"3, we observe wind speed has a unimodal and symmetric distribution.",,,
The mode is between 4.5 to 4.9 km/h and there are some potential outliers at 8.5 km/h and 9.5 km/h.,,,
"Fine Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC) is a quantitative variable that measures the fuel moisture level for surface-level forest litter, typically less than 1 inch deep.",,,
"It ranges from 0-101, with greater values indicating a higher likelihood of forest fires.",,,
The mean FFMC is 90.63 while the standard deviation is 5.57.,,,
Fig.,,,
"4 shows that the distribution of FFMC is unimodal, with the mode at 91, and strongly left-skewed.",,,
"There are some potential outliers at 84, 64 and 18.",,,
This is likely because FFMC is a good predictor of forest fire occurrences.,,,
"Consequently, higher values of FFMC tend to be associated with higher counts of forest fires.",,,
We first investigate if there is a correlation between total burned area and season.,,,
"To make a hypothesis on the correlation between the two, we first graphically examine the relationship between season and temperature.",,,
From Fig.,,,
"5, we observe that the median temperature is the highest in the summer months.",,,
"Since high temperatures mean the heat requirements for combustion and ignition are more likely to be fulfilled, the fire is likely to spread to a wider area under high temperature conditions.",,,
"Hence, we hypothesize that the total burned area is the highest in Summer.",,,
We now proceed to graphically investigate the relationship between total area burned and season via a box plot in Fig.,,,
6.,,,
"Interestingly, the median total area burned is the highest in Winter, as compared to the other seasons.",,,
Summer and Fall have many noticeable outliers on the right side while Winter only has one outlier.,,,
"In particular, the maximum total area burned is 86.45 ha and 95.18 ha for Summer and Fall respectively while the maximum is only 51.78 ha for Winter.",,,
"Hence, it appears that the evidence refutes the initial hypothesis that the total burned area is the highest in Summer.",,,
"Although the spread of the fire is the highest on average in Winter, the seasons of Summer and Fall are more prone to instances of forest fires that burn a large area of land.",,,
"In the Dataset section, we also noted that Summer and Fall higher occurrences of forest fires as compared to the other seasons.",,,
"Hence, this suggests that forest fires happen in Summer and Fall happen frequently, but do not often spread to a very large area on average.",,,
"However, during the exceptional occurrences where the forest fire does spread to a large area, the total area burned tends to be higher than that in Winter.",,,
We postulate that this might be because forest fires in the Summer and Fall are generally more difficult to manage and contain due to the relatively higher temperatures.,,,
Our second research question focuses on investigating the relationship between wind speed and total burned area.,,,
"The presence of wind supplies more oxygen to support combustion and well as physically moving the fire and embers towards more fuel, hence increasing the spread of the fire.",,,
"Hence, we hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between wind and total burned area.",,,
"We investigate this by plotting wind speed against total area burned in a scatterplot, as shown in Fig.",,,
7.,,,
From Fig.,,,
"7, the plot does not look reasonably linear, exhibiting a cloud-like appearance instead.",,,
"The correlation coefficient between wind speed and total area burned is at 0.071, which shows the relationship is not linear.",,,
"Hence, we conclude that there is no correlation between wind speed and total area burned.",,,
Our third research question is to determine whether FFMC is associated with total area burned.,,,
"Since FFMC shows higher values when surface fuel moisture levels are low, we hypothesize that FFMC should have a positive relationship with total area burned, since drier fuels are more likely to ignite.",,,
"In our analysis, we further filter the dataset to exclude outliers.",,,
We defined outliers as data with values lower than 1.5 times of the Inter-Quartile Range subtracted from the 1st Quartile or higher than 1.5 times of the Inter-Quartile Range added to the 1st Quartile.,,,
"Despite accounting for outliers, the plot does not look reasonably linear.",,,
"The correlation coefficient is 0.052, suggesting the relationship is not linear.",,,
"Hence, there is no association between FFMC and total area burned.",,,
"Combining this observation with the distribution of FFMC from the Dataset section, we conclude that FFMC is more accurate at predicting the occurrence of forest fires, but is less accurate at determining the overall impact of the fire as measured by total area burned.",,,
"Discussion In this study, we investigated the factors that affect the total area burned in 517 forest fires in the Montesinho natural park.",,,
"Surprisingly, we found that total burned area is highest in Winter.",,,
There was total burned area was not associated with wind speed and FFMC respectively.,,,
"Despite the lack of a relationship between the extent of burning and FFMC, we observed that FFMC seems to be accurate in predicting the occurrence of forest fires.",,,
The dataset we analyzed had limitations in the way the total area burned by the fire was represented.,,,
Forest fires that burned less than 0.1 ha of land were all rounded up to 0.1 ha.,,,
"However, there was a large proportion of data points with total area burned less than 0.1.",,,
This caused any differences between the total area burned that occurred below 0.1 ha to go undetected.,,,
Future research could analyze effect of wind speed on forest fires that affected an area smaller than 0.1 ha.,,,
"Furthermore, future research could investigate the fire management response times in different seasons, so as to explain why total area burned was higher on average in Winter.",,,
