Introduction: The diamond seems to be a motif of cultural fixation in America.,,,
"Diamonds are synonymous with wealth, endurance, and luxury.",,,
"The diamond wedding ring seems to be a particularly stubborn figment of American curiosity; the sign of devotion, true love, wealth, and a lasting marriage, given from one spouse to another, seems to be a hallmark of the modern fairytale.",,,
"However, beyond the acknowledgement that diamonds are expensive, it seems unclear what specific standards make them expensive.",,,
"We will examine different standards a diamond is judged on, and how each affects the price.",,,
"We shall do this in hopes of clarifying which factors most intensely affect the price of a diamond, and what standards a person should expect for a price point when purchasing a diamond.",,,
"Dataset: The dataset is a sample of 5000 diamonds, though the source of this data is unlisted, it was provided to us on ISLE.",,,
"The primary variable of this analysis will be price, a quantitative variable that measures the final price of a diamond in dollars.",,,
"The median, as above, ($2405.5) is notably lower than the mean ($3859.48, rounded), which indicates a possible right skew to price, with possible outliers being much more expensive than the majority of the sample.",,,
"The standard deviation is $3906.04, rounded up to whole cent.",,,
"By examining the histogram above, we can confirm the prediction that there is a right skew for the variable price.",,,
"While most of the diamonds of the sample seem to cost less than $10,000, there are a small fraction of the sampled diamonds that cost more than that and drag the mean higher.",,,
The research questions that follow will primarily pertain to two other variables: cut and carat.,,,
"Cut is a categorical variable that describes the quality of shape of the diamond, on a ranking scale from Fair to Ideal.",,,
"As illustrated by the bar chart, the most common ranking among the sample is Ideal; 1930 diamonds (38.6% of the sample) were given this label.",,,
"The least common rank was Fair, as only 152 diamonds (3.04% of the sample) were assigned to this rank.",,,
"While this is a categorical variable, there seems to be a hierarchy to the categories.",,,
"The best, or highest quality, is Ideal, which is followed by, in descending order, Premium, Very Good, Good, and Fair.",,,
Carat is a quantitative variable that measures the weight of each diamond in the sample.,,,
"For reference, 1 carat equates to about 200 milligrams.",,,
"Below is a statistics chart that shows the mean, median, and standard deviation for carat across the sample.",,,
"As shown in the chart, the mean (0.793 carats) is greater than a standard deviation (0.469 carats) from the median (0.700 carats).",,,
"This might indicate a skew to the right, with possible notable outliers comprising of much larger diamonds.",,,
"Based on the above histogram of carat, we can confirm the prediction regarding the skew of carat.",,,
"The larger outliers, in this case, seem to be between about 2.25 and 3, and while there are only a small amount of them, they do affect the mean.",,,
"Another interesting trend revealed through this histogram is the tendency for higher “spikes” of diamonds around round numbers of carats such as 1, 1.5, or 2.",,,
This might indicate that round carat diamonds are more popular or easier to sell or price.,,,
"There are a few other variables within the data set that we have not mentioned, primarily because they have little to do with the research scenarios.",,,
"The Relationship Between Cut and Price In order to understand the way a diamond is priced, it is important analyze different assessments of quality.",,,
"The first of these quality assessments will be cut, which is considered one of the traditional 4 Cs of assessing diamond quality.",,,
"Out of these four variables (cut, carat, clarity, color), cut is perhaps the most convoluted, since most average people do not have a nuanced knowledge of what makes a cut of a diamond “good.” Thus, we seek to answer how cut affects the price of a diamond.",,,
"We hypothesize that the most expensive cut will be Ideal, and then in descending order of price: Premium, Very Good, Good, and Fair.",,,
"Though cut is a qualitative variable, there is an order to the categories, so it seems reasonable to assume that the “lowest” category in terms of quality (Fair) will cost the least.",,,
"Due to the significant overlap of IQRs and relatively similar medians, it seems unlikely that cut has much of a relationship with price.",,,
"The only possible relationship to this would be Ideal, which has a slightly smaller median than the rest of the categories, which may hint that Ideal diamonds might run slightly cheaper than other categories (the Ideal median is about $1000 less than most of the other means).",,,
"While this has little effect on our conclusion, there are also a significant number of outliers for each category, though Fair has fewer outliers over a wider range than most of the other categories.",,,
This might be because there are the fewest number of diamonds in the fair category.,,,
"Effectively, our hypothesis was incorrect, since there was no hierarchy of cost for the categories of quality for cut.",,,
The Relationship Between Carat and Price The next assessment of quality to be assessed will be carat.,,,
"Similarly to cut, carat is one of the traditional 4 Cs of assessing diamond quality.",,,
"However, carat might be the most well known assessment categories, considering its prevalence in advertisements.",,,
"Because it is so well known and prevalent, it is important to investigate how it affects price.",,,
"When asking how carat might correlate with price, it seems reasonable to assume that there will be a positive correlation, and that the points will fall relatively tightly around the regression line.",,,
"If a diamond is heavier (which might correlate with size), we hypothesize that the diamond will be more expensive, under the assumption that a larger amount of something will cost more than a smaller amount.",,,
Above is the scatterplot of price vs. carat.,,,
"While the points do not fall extremely tightly around the regression line, the overall trend of the data is positive.",,,
Most of the data points seem to fall between 0 and 1.75 carats.,,,
"There also appear to be some remarkable outliers above and below the regression line and towards the right end of the graph, as well as vertical clusters of points around round carat values such as 1, 1.5, and 2.",,,
These clusters are reminiscent of the histogram of carat discussed earlier.,,,
"Because of the apparent linearity of the data set, analyzing the regression fit will be useful.",,,
The table detailing that data is below.,,,
"The slope of the regression line (approximately 7677.68) confirms the positive trend of the data, and, in context, means that for every increase of a carat for a diamond, the price raises about $7677.68 on average.",,,
"It is important to note that rather than a diamond being able to cost a negative amount of dollars, the negative intercept seems to suggest that there is a minimum fraction value of a carat that is required before a diamond is worthy of being sold.",,,
"Though they are prized and expensive, this shows that diamonds under a certain carat are functionally worthless, rather than every diamond, regardless of size, being sellable or having a price.",,,
This is meaningful as it reveals more about how carat impacts price.,,,
"Overall, this trend seems to confirm out hypothesis that there would be a positive relationship between number of carats and price.",,,
"The Relationship Between Cut and Carat The final question we posit is not directly related to what standards of quality affect the price of a diamond, but rather regarding the relationship between two variables that may affect the perceived quality: is there a correlation between cut and carat?",,,
"We hypothesize that a better cut— for instance Ideal or Premium— will have a lower carat size, due to the belief that a more prized cut might require more mass of the diamond cut away.",,,
"As the chart shows, four out of the five cut categories fall in the range of 0.7-0.9 carats in terms of median.",,,
"The outlier is Ideal, whose mean carat value is 0.540.",,,
"This could mean that there is no sense of hierarchy, and that there is no correlation between carat and cut, because of how close all of the medians fall.",,,
"However, there is an alternate way that this can be interpreted, rather that there is a hierarchy of values, and that Premium’s median is the outlier; if Premium’s median is removed, then the order of carat value from high to low would be Fair (0.900), Good (0.790), Very Good (0.710), Ideal (0.540), which would fit with the hierarchy of cut in quality order.",,,
"This interpretation could possibly affirm our hypothesis that the higher quality of a cut, the lower the carat value.",,,
"However, it is difficult to prove these theories one way or another.",,,
"Without a specific measure of proof towards the correlation, it is better to label this as tentatively having no relationship and disproving our hypothesis.",,,
"Discussion: Based on this data and analysis presented above, we can offer some answers to the original question posed.",,,
"Out of the variables presented here, carat seems to be the only one that correlates with price, and it demonstrates a positive correlation.",,,
"Cut seems somewhat irrelevant in terms of price, since there was no obvious relationship between the two.",,,
"Furthermore, cut and carat do not seem to vary together, though there is some ambiguity in the data.",,,
"From this, the the primary variable that effects diamond price is the carat of the diamond, while the standards of cut have little effect.",,,
"This was surprising to us, as we thought that the hierarchized nature of cut would equate to changes in price based on cut.",,,
"As of right now, the true function of having cut be an evaluative variable in diamond quality, if not price determination, is unknown to us.",,,
It is important to note the our limitations in analysis; there are surely measures that we are yet to learn that would remove ambiguity from our data to give a more clear picture.,,,
"From there, we could also use not-yet-learned tools to make more sophisticated and concrete conclusions regarding the data.",,,
"Also, we are relatively unfamiliar with the diamond trade as a whole and the complex machinations of it.",,,
"Perhaps there are specific values to cuts that do not show up in comparative data with price or carat, but are nonetheless important to know when purchasing a diamond.",,,
"Finally, for future analyses of this data set, examining different variables in relation with price, and how other variable vary with each other could help to construct a more concrete map of how diamond prices are decided, and how different aspects interplay to create that price.",,,
