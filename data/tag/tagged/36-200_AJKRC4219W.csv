Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
"During my free time, I often watch youtube videos to relax",Context,,,Intro,
There were two people in my high school in the same grade who upload youtube videos regularly,Context,,,Intro,
"After being forced to subscribe to them, I realized they have different amounts of subscribers: one has around one thousand subscribers whereas the other one has almost twenty thousands",Context,,,Intro,
The one with less subscribers created his account during his senior year of high school and focused mainly on music,Context,,,Intro,
"the other one created his account during his sophomore year of high school, focused mainly on entertainment, and has uploaded more videos",Context,,,Intro,
"In addition, the one with more subscribers also has more views in each video he uploaded",Context,,,Intro,
"Base on the data set I found from ISEL (https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/36-200-A,B,C,D,E,G spring21/youtube_project1/), which contains information up to the end of 2018, provides analytics and tracks per-channel information like the number of subscribers and the number of views",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"I can figure out if there’s a relationship between subscribers and viewsPerVideo, relationship between subscribers and accountAge, and relationship between subscribers and videoUploads",RQDef,,,Intro,
Data,Title,,,Data,
"To help users monitor their statistics and online presence, the dataset comes from data gathered by Social Blade and contains information up to the end of 2018",DataDesc,,,Data,
"Each row in the data is a YouTube channel, and information on each channel includes viewing metrics and channel topic and origin",DataDesc,,,Data,
Below is the column of each dataset,Struct,,,Data,
The age of the account in weeks,DataDesc,,,Data,
Note that for consistency the age calculation was performed on December 31 2018,DataDesc,,,Data,
"I will use data from “category,” “accountAge,” “videoUploads,'“ and “subscribers” to answer my overall research question: is the number of subscribers affected by viewsPerVideo, accountAge, or videoUploads",RQDef,DataDesc,,RS,
The relationship between two quantitative variables could be represented by a scatterplot,MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"Blow is a scatterplot, having “viewsPerVideo” on the x-axis and “subscribers” on the y-axis",Struct,,,RS,
"The two quantitative variables here are subscribes (the y-axis), and videoUploads (the x-axis)",Other,,,RS,?
Below is the scatterplot representing the relationship between the two quantitative variables,Struct,,,RS,
"This time the two quantitative variables in the scatterplot below are subscribers (y-axis), and accountAge (x-axis)",Other,,,RS,
The accountAge is measured by the age of the account in weeks,DataDesc,,,RS,
Above is the linear regression model table,Struct,,,RS,
"Based on the table, we can generate the formula that predicts the number of subscribers at a certain accountAge",MethDef,,,RS,
The formula here is: Y=89.77+14.33X (round to two decimals place),ResDesc,,,RS,?
Discussion,Title,,,Discuss,
There are numerous factors that affect the numbers of subscribers of any youtube channels,RQDef,,,Discuss,
"In this project, I focus on whether or not the number of subscribers is affected by viewsPerVideo, accountAge, or videoUploads",RQDef,,,Discuss,
"Before any work was done, I thought all the three factors affect the number of subscribers to some extent, however, the exploratory data analysis show there’s no relationship between subscribers and viewsPerVideo, and there’s no relationship between subscribers and videoUploads, whereas there’s a positive linear relationship between subscribers and accountAge",ResDesc,,,Discuss,
This could be one of the reasons why the two people in my high school have different numbers of subscribers: the one with more subscribers created his account 2 years earlier than the one with less subscribers,IntImp,,,Discuss,
