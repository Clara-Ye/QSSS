Introduction,,,,,
"As social media continues to dominate our everyday lives, and a global pandemic limits our in-person interactions, dating apps and websites are being utilized at an increasing rate",,,,,
"Between the years of 2019 and 2020, the amount of individuals using dating services increased from 250 million to 270 million, and is only expected to grow (as detailed, for instance, in Business of Apps, March 10th, 2021 https://www.businessofapps.com/data/dating-app-market/)",,,,,
"As this market increases, it is critical to understand how these apps and websites can feed and inform how sex and gender interacts with other societal norms",,,,,
"In this project, we will explore how sex is related to high income, education level, and drinking preferences",,,,,
Data,,,,,
"We will be using information collected from a 2012 study that collected data from the San Francisco are, from 1,500 users",,,,,
"The primary focus of this project will be on Sex, a categorical variable that represents the sex of each OkCupid user",,,,,
"For the purpose of this project, we will be viewing gender and sex in a binary sense, with solely male and female categories",,,,,
We will be examining how the factor of sex interacts with other variables in the study,,,,,
"These additional variables are income, education, and drinking",,,,,
"Income is a quantitative variable that measures the yearly income of the OkCupid users, measured in dollars",,,,,
"The user can choose from twelve options, the lowest being 20,000 dollars and the highest being 1,000,000 dollars",,,,,
The next variable that this project will examine is education,,,,,
Certain dating services users desire a partner with a specific educational level,,,,,
"Education is a categorical variable that assesses the education level of the OkCupid user, with twenty-eight options to summarize their educational experience",,,,,
The third and final variable we are considering in this project is drinking,,,,,
"Many people drink socially, dedicatedly, or not at all",,,,,
The subject of drinking can be an important factor in deciding on your romantic partner,,,,,
"Drinking is categorical variable, with seven options to choose from that describes drinking experiences",,,,,
Research Scenarios,,,,,
Our first hypothesis deals with the relationship between sex and income,,,,,
"Ultimately, we are interested in whether men make more than women in yearly income",,,,,
"However, first we have to see if there is a relationship between sex and income",,,,,
"Currently, unequal pay between men and women, with women receiving 82.3 cents per every male dollar, is an issue of injustice (as detailed, for instance, in Business Insider, March 24th, 2021, https://www.businessinsider.com/gender-wage-pay-gap-charts-2017-3)",,,,,
We hypothesize that men earn substantially more yearly income than their female counterpart,,,,,
"Let p(M) denote the population probability of men who earned a million dollars, and let p(F) denote the population probability of women who earned a million dollars",,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are,,,,,
"Before examining our null and alternative hypotheses, we want to view our two variables visually, with a comparative bar plot (Figure 5, below)",,,,,
"With orange representing women, and blue representing men, we can see that women consistently tend to earn less than men in every income group",,,,,
"However, in order to accurately test our hypotheses, we will perform a formal hypothesis test for a difference in proportions",,,,,
Females: (385)(0.091) = 35 ≥ 10 (385)(1- 0.091) = 345 ≥ 10,,,,,
Since our assumptions are met we can carry out our two-sample proportion test,,,,,
"After performing this test, we get a test statistic of 4.0258 and a pValue of 0.0001",,,,,
"As our pValue is less than 0.05, we reject our null hypothesis that the income yearly earnings of men and women are equal",,,,,
"We are given a confidence interval of [0.038, 0.1102], with -0.074 not fitting into the interval, it is not likely the true value",,,,,
"Therefore, we conclude that there is significant evidence that income varies according to one’s sex",,,,,
"Our second hypothesis explores the variables of sex and education, and whether one’s sex will influence their educational level",,,,,
"In American history, the gender gap in education was severe, with elite colleges not opening their doors to women until the early 1900’s",,,,,
"However, currently, women outnumber men at colleges and universities",,,,,
"(as detailed, for instance, in The Atlantic, Nov",,,,,
"27th, 2017, https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/11/gender-education-gap/546677/)",,,,,
"Therefore, examining whether sex and education have a relationship is subject of interest",,,,,
We hypothesize that there will be a relationship between sex and education,,,,,
"Let p(mC) denote the population probability of men who have graduated college or university, and let p(fC) denote the population probability of women who have graduated college or university",,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are,,,,,
"Before we conduct a two-sample proportion test, we again want to compare our variables visually",,,,,
"As we can see in Figure 6, seen below, the majority of individuals who have graduated from college/university have been male",,,,,
"However, there could be a number of additional factors that could be affecting the data, such as sample size and the number of options to choose from",,,,,
"Therefore, we will need to perform a formal hypothesis test",,,,,
Females: (385)(0.365) = 140.53 ≥ 10 (385)(1- 0.365) = 244.48 ≥ 10,,,,,
"After assumptions have been met, we can perform the two-sample proportion test",,,,,
Performing the test we get a statistic value of 1.1088 and a pValue of 1.1088,,,,,
"As our pValue is far greater than 0.05, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis",,,,,
"We are given a confidence interval of [-0.0004, 0.0161], with 0.008 fitting into the interval, making it a reasonable supposition",,,,,
"Therefore, it is fair to say that there is no relationship between sex and education",,,,,
Our third hypothesis examines if there is a relationship between one’s sex and one’s drinking preference,,,,,
"At least half of sexual victimization and abuse occurs when the woman is drunk, whether that is due to not being able to give consent or having their drink be roofied (as detailed, for instance, in The U.S",,,,,
"National Library of Medicine, Nov",,,,,
"9th, 2009, https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2784921/)",,,,,
"Therefore, it is important to understand if there is a relationship between the way someone drinks and their sex",,,,,
"Due to this, we hypothesize that women will drink less socially than men",,,,,
"Let p(mD) denote the population probability of men drinking socially, and let p(fD) denote the population probability of women drinking socially",,,,,
Our null and alternative hypotheses are,,,,,
"As done in the previous hypotheses, we want to compare our variables visually",,,,,
"Figure 7 shows us that the majority of individuals are drinking socially, which is our target of interest",,,,,
"As before, men outnumber women, which may be a result of uneven population sizes",,,,,
"Next, we need to construct our formal hypothesis",,,,,
Females: (385)(0.706) = 271.8 ≥ 10 (385)(1- 0.706) = 113.2 ≥ 10,,,,,
"After running our two-sample proportion test, we find that our statistic is -0.1964, and our pValue is 0.8443",,,,,
"Due to the fact that our pValue is more than 0.05, we do not have significant evidence to reject our null hypothesis",,,,,
"We are given a confidence interval of [-0.0587, 0.048], with 0.005 fitting into the interval, making it a reasonable supposition",,,,,
"Therefore, men and women drink socially the same amount",,,,,
Discussion,,,,,
"Our analysis focused on OkCupid, and the relationship between sex and three other variables: income, education, and drinking",,,,,
"Overall, we found that there is a relationship between sex and income, as originally hypothesized, with women making less than their men",,,,,
"However, unlike originally hypothesized, there is no relationship between sex and education, and sex and drinking",,,,,
There were some limitations with the data during this analysis,,,,,
The main one being a confusing amount of options for each individual to choose from within each variable,,,,,
"For example, in education, there were separate options of ‘college/university’ and ‘graduated from college/university’",,,,,
Creating more succinct categories would produce more digestible data,,,,,
Another limitation is the when the study was performed: 2012,,,,,
"Almost a decade ago, the way individuals use dating services has changed drastically with the introduction of Tinder and Bumble",,,,,
Both of these factors would affect the data and our conclusions,,,,,
"Finally, we believe that there is great future for this study",,,,,
"Dating services are an important part of our culture, and can help us understand how gender and sex affect society",,,,,
"For example, Bumble was created by a former Tinder employee who was tired of the sexism female users faced on the app (as detailed, for instance, in CNN, Dec",,,,,
"13th, 2019, https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/13/tech/whitney-wolfe-herd-bumble-risk-takers/index.html)",,,,,
"If we want to understand how sexism interacts with other societal tools (like income, education, and drinking), dating services are a great way to do so",,,,,
