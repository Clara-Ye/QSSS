Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
"It’s common knowledge that smoking, drinking, and doing drugs isn’t good for your body",Context,,,Intro,
"The Surgeon General has collected statistics about the adverse effects of smoking on the body that includes how ‘Cigarette smoking causes more than 480,000 deaths each year in the United States, equivalent to one in five deaths [1]",Context,,,Intro,
"A.H Mokdad, J.S Marks, and J.L Gerberding created a study called Actual causes of death in the United States finding an estimated 95,000 people die from alcohol-related causes annually [2]",Context,RQSig,,Intro,
"Lastly, drugs are known to lead to health hazards",Context,RQSig,,Intro,
"But how does this correlate with body type, a factor that can be another measure for health",RQDef,,,Intro,?
"In this study, we hope to find the relationship between doing these health detriments and body type",RQDef,,,Intro,
Data,Title,,,Data,
"The data used in this project was sourced from members on OkCupid, who have provided the data on body type, diet, drinking, drugs, education, drugs, and more on 1500 individuals that use OkCupid",DataDesc,,,Data,
"The data that we have on smoking is separated into five categorizations: yes, sometimes, when drinking, trying to quit, and no",DataDesc,,,Data,
"There exists a minority who had null answers to this question, creating some bias in the data",LimData,,,Data,
"From this data, we see that the majority of this sample of OkCupid users don’t smoke",DataStat,,,Data,
The Effects of Drinking on Body Type,Title,,,RS,
Our first analysis includes the effect of drinking on how fit you are,RQDef,,,RS,
"Here, we aim to find out if you should or should not drink if you want to be as fit as possible",RQSig,,,RS,?
"For our comparison, we have two categorical statistics, independent measurements within each cell, an expected count of at least five so we use the Chi-Square Test of Independence",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"Because of this, we know that the hypotheses are as follows",HypDef,,,RS,
H0: There is no association between drinking and body type (p > .05),HypDef,,,RS,
Ha: There exists a relationship between drinking and body type (p < .05),HypDef,,,RS,
"Performing a Chi-squared test on body_type and drinks gives us an x-squared value of 172.15, a df of 72, and a p-value of 3.512e-10",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Because the p-value is less than the threshold of .05, a relationship exists between drinking and body type",IntVar,,,RS,
"From here, we can reject the null hypothesis to find there is a relationship between drinking and body type and move on to examining the contingency table to find further connections between drinking and body type",IntVar,MethDef,Struct,RS,?
"From this table, we can see that the intersection of variables with the most population in the social drinkers that are average body type",ResDesc,,,RS,
"There is the most population in the social drinkers’ category, but there exists a higher proportion of fit social drinkers than overweight social drinkers, and a higher proportion of overweight individuals that don’t drink at all to fit individuals that don’t drink at all, and the general trends in the table point towards a positive correlation between drinking and how fit you are (the more you drink, the more fit you will be)",IntVar,ResDesc,,RS,
The Effects of Smoking on Body Type,Title,,,RS,
Our second analysis looks at the effects of smoking on how fit you are,RQDef,,,RS,
"Here, we aim to determine whether you should smoke or not if you want to aim to be fit",RQDef,,,RS,
"Again, we have two categorical data values, so we look to use a Chi-Square test to determine whether or not there is a correlation between smoking and body type",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"Again, our hypotheses are",HypDef,,,RS,
H0: There is no association between drinking and body type (p > .05),HypDef,,,RS,
Ha: There exists a relationship between smoking and body type (p < .05),HypDef,,,RS,
"Performing a Chi-squared test on body_type and drinks gives us an x-squared value of 111.6, a df of 60, and a p-value of .0000596",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Because the p-value is less than the threshold of .05, we can reject the null hypothesis and say that there exists a relationship between smoking and body type",IntVar,,,RS,
"Again, to further dissect this correlation and look for the trend, we generate a contingency table",MethDef,,,RS,
"From this table, we see that the most populated cell of the table is average body type while not smoking",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Here, we can see that the proportion of overweight non-smokers to total overweight individuals is greater than the proportion of fit non-smokers to total fit individuals",ResDesc,,,RS,
"However, this might be misleading due to the higher proportion of athletic non-smokers to total smokers compared to overweight non-smokers",IntImp,,,RS,
"From this information, we are unable to pinpoint the exact relationship between smoking and body type, but we can say that one exists",IntVar,,,RS,
The Effects of Drugs on Body Type,Title,,,RS,
Our final analysis aims to find the relationship between doing drugs and how fit you are,RQDef,,,RS,
"The variables are again both categorical, so we use a Chi-Square test to determine whether or not there is a correlation between doing drugs and body type",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
Our hypotheses are,HypDef,,,RS,
H0: There exists no relationship between drugs and body type (p > .05),HypDef,,,RS,
Ha: There exists a relationship between drugs and body type (p < .05),HypDef,,,RS,
"Our chi-square test returns an x squared value of 110.19, a df of 36, and a p-value of 1.884e-09",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Since the p-value is less than the threshold of .05, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a relationship between doing drugs and body type",IntVar,,,RS,
"From this table, we see that the most populated cell of the table is never done drugs with average body type",ResDesc,,,RS,
We again try to compare the proportions of variables we want to examine: the proportion of overweight individuals who have never done drugs to total overweight people is higher than both the proportion of fit people who have never done drugs to total individual fit people and the proportion of athletic people who have never done drugs to total individual athletic people,ResDesc,,,RS,
"From this information, we can say there is a positive correlation between doing drugs and being fit",IntVar,,,RS,?
Discussion,Title,,,Discuss,
"In this project, we looked at possible correlations between smoking, drinking, and doing drugs on body type, or specifically how fit an individual is",RQDef,,,Discuss,
"We concluded that a relationship exists between smoking and body type, drinking and body type, as well as doing drugs and body type",IntVar,,,Discuss,
"However, we were only able to find a positive correlation between drinking and body type and doing drugs and body type",IntVar,,,Discuss,
This suggests that it would be advisable to drink and do drugs in order to reach the goal of having a fit body,IntImp,,,Discuss,
"However, we must address the biases that exist in this study",LimData,,,Discuss,
"One major bias is that the data taken is from an OkCupid database, which means it isn’t simple random sampling, which technically invalidates the chi-square test",LimData,,,Discuss,
"However, we decided to overlook this because the sample of individuals with an OkCupid account could be similar to a random sample from the general population",LimData,,,Discuss,?
"Another bias is that there existed null values for all variables, which means some data is missing from the sample, which could invalidate the data",LimData,,,Discuss,
"If we were to continue with this study, we’d work towards simple random sampling as well as eliminating null values",FuWork,,,Discuss,
