"Introduction As most people already know, heart disease is the number one cause of death in Americans.",,,
This massive killer is usually related to unhealthy lifestyle habits such as a poor diet and lack of exercise.,,,
Heart disease is such a topic of interest both because of its prevalence and preventability.,,,
Our goal is to better understand the treatment people with heart disease are receiving.,,,
This information can help provide better quality care for those in need.,,,
Data The primary variable of focus will be the cost of treatment.,,,
"Medical treatment can be extremely expensive, to the point where many without insurance will not attempt to seek the care that they need.",,,
The data we have comes from 788 subscribers during the period of January 1998 through December 1999.,,,
"Our other variables of interest are comorbidities, or the number of other diseases the subscriber had, the number of medications prescribed, and the number of emergency room visits.",,,
"Research Scenarios First, we must characterize the distribution of the total cost of treatment.",,,
"Based on our knowledge of the medical field, we hypothesise that treatment is going to be relatively expensive with some outliers falling to the right of the majority depending on the quality of insurance the patient has.",,,
"Based on the histogram made using the variable cost (Figure 1 below), we can see that the most common amount claimed was less than $500 dollars.",,,
"Out of the total number of patients, most played between $300 and $5000 with outliers extending all the way until $50k.",,,
The next research question will be to characterize the number of comorbidities the subscriber had.,,,
We hypothesise that the cost of treatment will have a positive correlation to the cost of treatment as insurance tends to require higher premiums for people with pre existing conditions.,,,
We can summarize the cost by the number of comorbidities the patient has to see if there is a correlation between the two.,,,
"Based on Figure 2 above, we can see that there is actually not a large correlation between the number of pre existing conditions and the cost of treatment.",,,
"Looking at the linear fit, we can see that there is a positive slope suggesting cost is expected to generally go up as pre existing conditions increase, however, the data does not seem to follow that strong of a trend.",,,
We can verify that it is truly a poor correlation by calculating the correlation coefficient.,,,
The coefficient in this data set is 0.146 which indicates that there is barely a connection between the two variables.,,,
The next research question is how does cost change based on the number of medications prescribed.,,,
"Because some medication are extremely expensive, we would hypothesise that the cost would generally go up with the number of medications the patient went home with.",,,
"Based on Figure 3 below, we can see that patients that were sent home with multiple medications ended up being charged more than those that did not go home with any.",,,
"Looking at the box plot, we can still see a large amount of outliers to the right of the data, which are the patients that claimed a large amount regardless of the number of medications they were sent home with.",,,
The last research question we can examine is the number of emergency room visits and how it affects the cost.,,,
"Everyone knows that a trip to the hospital can be extremely expensive, so we can hypothesise that the cost will greatly increase depending on how many times the patients ended up in the emergency room.",,,
"Additionally, the emergency situations involving cardiac disease can be extremely costly depending on the invasiveness of the procedures required.",,,
"Looking at Figure 4, there is a linear correlation between the number of emergency room visits and the cost.",,,
"Even though there is a large number of data points at the lower left end of the graph, the outliers actually tend to follow the line of best fit well with the people with the largest bills having a high number of emergency room visits.",,,
"Discussion Our analysis found that in general, people with heart disease do not end up paying exorbitant amounts of money for their treatment.",,,
"However, there are definite factors that can be tied back to some of the patients with the highest bills at the end of their treatment.",,,
"Throughout the analysis, we looked at three factors that examine potential expenses at three different points.",,,
"By looking at comorbidities, we are able to see if there is any added cost from an insurance premium perspective, medication looks at the cost of the drugs themselves, and emergency room visits takes into account that particularly expensive aspect of treatment.",,,
"Overall, there seemed to be extreme variation in the data with each factor seeming to only affect a small portion of the sample.",,,
"Because there is no obvious variable that is significantly contributing to the cost, we can conclude that treatment is not standardized and some people are charged more for seemingly arbitrary reasons.",,,
"This just highlights one of the many shortcomings of the healthcare system, causing people to pay extremely large amounts for lifesaving treatment.",,,
