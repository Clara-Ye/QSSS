Introduction,,,,,
Money can buy almost anything in this world,,,,,
"However, no amount of money as of yet has been able to overcome mortality",,,,,
"To crack the mystery of immortality, we have been tasked by the billionaire, Preston Jorgensen, to research the necessary factors necessary to attain immortality",,,,,
"Specifically, Jorgensen tasked to us to determine whether slowing the metabolic rate increases lifespan and whether this relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is non-linear",,,,,
Jorgensen also noted that he wants the crab-eating raccoon as a pet to keep him company during his potentially immortal life,,,,,
"That being, he also tasked us with determining the average lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon's characteristics but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate given that Jorgensen would fund research to reduce the pet's metabolic rate by 50% (1)",,,,,
"To help answer these questions, we are using a subset of the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity",,,,,
The database we are using contains information on the ageing and life history of 347 species of animals collected across hundreds of scientific papers,,,,,
"Specifically, this dataset contains information on species' lifespan (years), body mass (grams), metabolic rate (watts), body temperature (kelvin), and several taxonomic classifications (i.e., kingdom, class, order, genus, phylum, species) (2)",,,,,
We will be analyzing this data to ultimately build a statistical model to examine the relationship between the lifespan and metabolic rate of animals,,,,,
"After evaluating several models and variable characteristics, our research led us to the conclusion that a slower metabolic rate does have a significant impact in increasing lifespans",,,,,
"We found that this relationship is after using log transformations on lifespan and metabolic rate, their relationship is approximately linear",,,,,
We also found that a 50% reduction in the metabolic rate for the crab-eating raccoon would yield an average lifespan between 18.6 and 23 years (3),,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,
The key variables we will be exploring will be lifespan and metabolic rates across the 347 species in the subset of the AnAge Database,,,,,
"For our analysis, we defined metabolic rate as the amount of energy used per body mass (watts/grams), rather than solely the amount of energy used, to allow for comparisons across different animals of different sizes",,,,,
"That being, metabolic rate is our key covariate used to predict our response variable, lifespan (1)",,,,,
"Before we build our models, we must explore the shape and distribution of each variable indivdualy",,,,,
We will start by exploring our response variable,,,,,
"In figure 1, we can see a histogram and boxplot for the lifespan of animals",,,,,
The histogram visualizes the distribution of this variable as being skewed right without a normal distribution while the boxplot clearly shows 7 outliers comprised of animals with large lifespans ranging from about 45 to nearly 125 years (3),,,,,
"As for metabolic rate, figure 2 displays the histogram and boxplot that visualizes its distribution",,,,,
The histogram visualizes the shape of the distribution as also being skewed right without a normal distribution while the boxplot displays there are over 10 outliers with relatively high metabolic rates,,,,,
"It's important to note that although the histogram visualization may suggest that there are animals with metabolic rates of zero, the lowest metabolic rate in this dataset is 0.04 watts/grams (2)",,,,,
Next we will explore the relationships between animals' lifespans and their metabolic rates to better understand how to fit the models,,,,,
Figure 3 depicts scatterplots of the lifespan and metabolic rate variables with different combinations of log transformations with a linear regression smoother,,,,,
We decided to use log transformations because of the skewness in their shape along with the fact that neither of the variables had zero values in their range,,,,,
The first plot in this figure visualizes the relationship between the two variables without any transformations,,,,,
"Looking at this scatterplot, we can see that their relationship is inverse but it is certainly not linear",,,,,
The other three scatterplots depict the log transformation combinations with a linear trend line to help visualize which transformation pair elicits the most linear relationship,,,,,
We concluded that a log transformation on both of the variables provides the most linear relationship as the points on this scatterplot most closely follow the linear smoother (4),,,,,
"This log-log scatterplot, on the bottom right of figure 4, visualizes clearly visualizes the roughly linear and inverse relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate",,,,,
Such that lower metabolic rates appear to be related to larger lifespans,,,,,
This insight gives us valuable preliminary information before we begin building our model and answering Jorgensen's research questions (5),,,,,
"Also, our conclusion to conduct a log-log transformation on the data is supported when we explore the effect of these transformations on the distribution of each variable",,,,,
Figure 4 depicts the histograms of the log-transformed lifespan and metabolic rate variables,,,,,
"Comparing these histograms to those in figures 1 and 2, we can see that both variables are more centered and are less skewed to the right",,,,,
"However, we must not that the log-transformed metabolic rate distribution is slightly skewed to the left although it appears significantly more normal than without the transformation (5)",,,,,
"Since these variables are not perfectly normally distributed with the log transformations and their relationship is only approximately linear, this suggests that a non-parametric model might best capture the relationship in the data rather than a linear model",,,,,
"However, we still expect both models to depict an inverse relationship between metabolic rates and lifespans across animals and also both models will use this log-log transformation (6)",,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,
We constructed a linear model and 5 smooth spline models to fit the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate and answer Jorgensen's questions,,,,,
These models can be seen below,,,,,
Linear model: $ln(Lifespan_i) = beta_1 ln(Metabolic  Rate_i) + epsilon_i$ (1) Smooth Spline models: $ln(Lifespan_i) = s_{df}(ln(Metabolic  Rate_i)) + epsilon_i$ (2) Note that neither model includes an intercept term because its interpretation in the context of this research would be an extrapolation since metabolic rate would have to equal 1 (log(1) = 0) which would mean that an animal’s energy consumption is exactly equivalent to its body mass,,,,,
"As this is impossible and the maximum value of metabolic rate in the dataset is 0.04, having an intercept for the models would not make sense",,,,,
"For the spline model, s() denotes a non-linear smoothing function with df number of degrees of freedom",,,,,
"In this context, df includes 3,4,5,6, and 7 such that there are five smoothing spline models, one for each unique value of degrees of freedom",,,,,
"We decided to use linear and smooth spline models to analyze whether the data can be better fit by a linear model, suggesting that the data is linear, or if a non-linear approach yielded a better fit",,,,,
We varied the degrees of freedom in our smooth spline model to test which level of complexity would yield the best fit while not changing the overall shape of the non-parametric model,,,,,
"As for additional covariates, we examined the addition of the temperature variable (kelvin) to the linear model both with a log transformation and without one",,,,,
"After conducting an ANOVA test on our simple and these more complex models, we chose to favor our simpler model as both tests yielded p-values greater than 0.05 (log-transformed temperature: p = 0.3361, non-transformed temperature: p-value = 0.2252)",,,,,
We were not concerned about the simplicity of our model as there were no other potential confounders within the dataset that may influence both the metabolic rate and lifespan of animals,,,,,
We didn’t test the inclusion of body mass (grams) into the models as this would have surely resulted in multicollinearity due to our interpretation of metabolic rate as the amount of energy used per body mass (watts/grams),,,,,
"Next in our modeling analysis, we will determine which of these six models best fit the data by calculating each model’s prediction error using cross-validation techniques",,,,,
Table 1 depicts the prediction errors and standard errors for the linear and spline models we produced using 5-fold cross-validation (3),,,,,
"Based on these results, we determined that the spline model with 6 degrees of freedom provided the best fit for the data since it has the smallest prediction error (0.3538)",,,,,
It is important to note that the difference between all 6 of these models did not appear to be significant,,,,,
Such that the differences between the prediction errors of the best model versus all the other models (ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0119) are less than the best model's estimated standard error (0.016),,,,,
This suggests that differences between the models are not significant and depending on the random folds selected in our cross-validation other models may have the lowest prediction error,,,,,
This means that we can not confidently say that our best performing smooth spline model is a better fit to the data than a linear model,,,,,
"With that said, we will continue to use the smooth spline model with 6 degrees of freedom as our selected model freedom since it produces the lowest prediction error (5)",,,,,
"Next, we will examine the model and residual diagnostics for our selected plot",,,,,
Figure 5 visualizes the scatter plot of the log-transformed lifespan and metabolic rate with a smoothing spline trend line with 6 degrees of freedom,,,,,
The trend line appears to capture the shape of the relationship between the two variables well without overfitting,,,,,
"However, this is only a preliminary conclusion",,,,,
We must now examine the residual diagnostics to see whether the model assumptions hold for the smooth spline,,,,,
"Model assumptions for smooth splines are similar to those of linear models such that they include the errors are normal, homoskedastic, and that the observations are independent",,,,,
Figure 6 depicts the residual plot and qq plot for our selected model,,,,,
Note that only plotting against the fitted values is equivalent to plotting against the log of metabolic rate since our model only has one predictor,,,,,
"Based on the residual plot, the residuals appear to have a random spread approximately centered about zero",,,,,
"However, there may be some heteroskedasticity such that residuals for larger values of the log of metabolic rate are mostly negative",,,,,
This is a minor violation of the homoskedasticity assumption,,,,,
"Looking at the qqplot, we can see that the points closely follow the diagonal with only minor deviations at the tails",,,,,
This suggests that the residuals are normally distributed,,,,,
To improve our model to address this minor error of heteroskedasticity we could have used a robust smoothing spline which includes robust standard errors within our smoothing spline model,,,,,
"Other than this minor deviation, our model met all the assumptions necessary and appears to fit well (4)",,,,,
To determine which bootstrapping method is appropriate for this data we must refer to our conclusions from examining the residual diagnostics,,,,,
"Given that we identified slight heteroskedasticity and our smoothing spline model is not linear, we can not conduct a fully parametric or resampling of residuals bootstrap method",,,,,
"Rather, we should use a resampling of cases approach which only makes the assumption that the log of lifespan and log of metabolic rate variables are independent and identically distributed random variables",,,,,
"Furthermore, even if the residuals can be interpreted as homoskedastic, the resampling cases method would remain valid which makes it a statistically appropriate method either way (6)",,,,,
Results,,,,,
"Using the smoothing spline model with 6 degrees of freedom, we examined the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate to determine whether lower metabolic rates resulted in longer lifespans",,,,,
Figure 7 visualizes a scatterplot of the predicted log of lifespans given the log of metabolic rates,,,,,
"From this graph, we can see that animals with lower metabolic rates also tend to have longer lifespans",,,,,
This relationship appears to be relatively constant except for animals with log metabolic rates between -8 and -7,,,,,
"For these animals, their lifespans appear to be equivalent and not change with their metabolic rate",,,,,
"However, for the most part, we see an inverse relationship between the log metabolic rate and log lifespan in this graph (1)",,,,,
"Next, we sought to determine the average lifespan of the crab-eating raccoon with a 50% smaller metabolic rate",,,,,
"To first tackle this question, we identified the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics to calculate its smaller metabolic rate, input that value into our model to determine the estimated mean log of lifespan and then perform an exponential transformation on that result to get an interpretable output in years",,,,,
"We found that with a 50% smaller metabolic rate, an animal with the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics has a mean lifespan of 20.78 years (2)",,,,,
"Although the lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon with a standard metabolic rate is 19 years, we can not be certain that reducing its metabolic rate by 50% results in an increased lifespan until we derive a pivotal confidence interval",,,,,
We calculated a 95% pivotal confidence interval for the mean lifespan using 1000 bootstrap iterations,,,,,
This confidence interval yielded a range of 18.57 to 22.98 years for the mean lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon with a 50% slower metabolic rate,,,,,
"Given that the original lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon, 19 years, is within this interval we can not confidently conclude that reducing the metabolic rate of Jorgensen’s pet by 50% will result in a lifespan greater than its original one without the metabolic rate reduction (3)",,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,
"In this study, we used a smooth spline model with 6 degrees of freedom to examine the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan",,,,,
"We found that their relationship is inverse, such that slower metabolic rates yield longer lifespans",,,,,
"However, this inverse relationship is not constant throughout all values of metabolic rates",,,,,
"After conducting log transformations on both variables, we found that their relationship is also approximately linear (1)",,,,,
We tested potential confounding variables in the dataset and determined that a simple model produced the best fit for the data's relationship,,,,,
"Although the relationship between the transformed variables is linear, we decided to use a non-parametric smoothing spline model because it yielded the lowest prediction errors among the models tested, including the linear model",,,,,
"Using our selected model, we examined whether reducing the metabolic rate of Jorgensen's crab-eating raccoon would cause its lifespan to change",,,,,
"Through a 95% pivotal confidence interval of 18.57 to 22.98 years, we concluded that this reduction in the pet's metabolic rate would not yield a change to its lifespan since its original lifespan of 19 years is within this confidence interval (2)",,,,,
"As for limitations in our analysis, I believe that there are potential confounders unaccounted for in the AnAge database that impact animal lifespans",,,,,
It may have been useful to control for other characteristics such as caloric consumption and endangered species classifications,,,,,
Diets of animals may have an impact on their lifespan because scavengers and other animals who have trouble finding consistent food may prematurely die of hunger rather than natural causes,,,,,
"Also, it would have been useful to know which animals were classified as endangered species because endangered animals may have some hunting protections such that their lifespans will not be cut short by hunters",,,,,
Whereas other animals that are not endangered and do not have hunting protections may have shorter lifespans on average after controlling for other relevant animal characteristics,,,,,
Including these variables in my regression models may have led to different model selections and would have better identified the true relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan (3),,,,,
