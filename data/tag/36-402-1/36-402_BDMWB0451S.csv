Introduction,,,,,
"Throughout history, the quest for immortality has remained a tried and true staple of humanity",,,,,
"Many great journeys were taken to try to achieve this great feat, such as trying to discover the mystical Fountain of Youth or the Holy Grail",,,,,
"However, given the sudden boom in biological research, it now suddenly seems possible that the key to immortality is not a magical ruin or long-lost relic, but it is instead within your own body at this very minute",,,,,
"Recent research suggests that slowing metabolic rate may improve longevity or lifespan, indicating a possible relationship between metabolic rate and immortality",,,,,
"In this study, we aim to discover if this theory is supported with evidence, and, if so, what is the most likely relationship between metabolic rate and improved lifespan",,,,,
"(1) We would also like to use our model to try to accurately predict lifespan based on metabolic rate for all creatures, allowing us to know exactly how much to reduce metabolic rate to generate a specific lifespan",,,,,
"In this study, we will be analyzing the relationship or metabolic rate on lifespan using data collected the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity",,,,,
"This database contains compiled information from many species, specifically regarding the species lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, typical body temperature, and metabolic rate",,,,,
We will be using a specific set of data containing information from 347 different species in the Chordata phylum (meaning we collected data from only vertebrates),,,,,
"The data includes a unique identifying number for each entry (a HAGRID), information on the species' kingdom, common name, maximum lifespan (years), body mass (in grams), temperature (in Kelvin), and finally metabolic rate (in Watts), which is the typical resting metabolic rate (rate of energy used) of the species",,,,,
"(2) We concluded that the true relationship is negative and linear, meaning that as the metabolic rate of a species decreases, the lifespan of the species appears to increase in a linear fashion",,,,,
(3),,,,,
Exploratory Data Analysis,,,,,
Data,,,,,
"In this study, we will be analyzing metabolic rate divided by the body mass of the species in grams to assess the amount of energy used per unit of body mass, allowing us to accurately compared the lifespans of animals who are different sizes by removing the effect size might have on metabolic rate",,,,,
(1) This new measure of energy per unit of body mass will be reported in Watts per grams,,,,,
Exploratory Analysis,,,,,
"Initially, we observed univariate distributions of metabolic rate (Watts), body mass (grams), lifespan (years), and the metabolic rate per body mass (Watts per grams) as these are going to be the key variables in our model",,,,,
"(1) As can be seen in figure 1, the metabolic rate for most species is roughly the same, with only a few outliers",,,,,
"Similarly, the body mass of the species appears to be roughly the same, as can be seen in figure 2",,,,,
"This means that the distribution of metabolic rate per unit body mass should also be roughly the same for most species, which can be seen in figure 3 with the right-skewed distribution with small intervals between each bar",,,,,
"Finally, the distribution of the untransformed response variable, maximum longevity or lifespan, can be seen in figure 4, where we notice that the variable lifespan has a distribution which is skewed slightly to the right",,,,,
(2),,,,,
"Next, we will assess any relationships between predictor variables and the response variable, longevity",,,,,
"We can see in figure 5 that there seems to be a strong correlation of data in the bottom left of the graph, signifying that the lower the metabolic rate per unit body mass, the shorter the lifespan",,,,,
"(4) However, there are many outliers that make assessing this plot extremely difficult, and as the data is extremely clustered, suggesting perhaps a logarithmic or exponential transformation of both variables may provide a better, more understandable relationship, as right now it is impossible to tell the distribution of the true relationship (we cannot tell if it is linear)",,,,,
"(4) Similarly, in figures 6 and 7 we can see that there is an extremely skewed distribution between both metabolic rate and lifespan as well as body mass and lifespan, with almost seemingly no relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan or body mass and lifespan",,,,,
"As such, we performed an exponential transformation on the metabolic rate per unit body mass and the lifespan variables to try to better ascertain any underlying relationships",,,,,
"After both transformations, there seems to be a moderately strong, negative, linear correlation between metabolic rate per unit body mass and lifespan of a species, as can be seen in figure 8",,,,,
"(4) It is worth noting that during preliminary analysis, assessing the inverse of lifespan versus logarithmic-transformed metabolic rate per unit body mass seems to reveal a possible nonlinear relationship between the two variables (shown in figure 9), and during this report this possibility will be tested using nonparametric modeling to check if a nonlinear fit is more appropriate",,,,,
"(5) However, as the square root of both lifespan and metabolic rate per unit body mass do show a moderate, negative linear relationship, the exploratory data analysis suggests that the true underlying relationship may support the initial research that metabolic rate and lifespan are negatively correlated (a lower metabolic rate leads to a longer lifespan)",,,,,
(6),,,,,
Modeling & Diagnostics,,,,,
Exploratory Analysis,,,,,
"Table 1: Table of Cross Validation Errors In order to determine the most accurate regression model for the data, we will begin by constructing a simple linear model which predicts the square root of the lifespan of a species from the square root of their metabolic rate per unit body mass to try to model the relationship between the two variables",,,,,
"(1) Next, we wish to assess if a linear model is truly the correct fit, and as such we will employ smoothing splines to create a more flexible model",,,,,
"(2) As can be seen in table 1, the estimated predicted mean squared error (MSE) of the linear model is the lowest at 0.103, whereas the estimated predicted MSE's of the splines corresponding to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 degrees of freedom are 1.287, 1.282, 1.294, 0.114, 0.109 respectively",,,,,
"Additionally, the estimated standard error for the linear model is approximately 0.0008, which is much lower than the standard errors of all the spline models (as is seen in table 1)",,,,,
"As such, the linear model is the best model for estimating the relationship between metabolic rate per unit body mass and lifespan of a species",,,,,
(3) We will next show diagnostic plots for this model to determine if it is a good fit,,,,,
"Figure 10 shows the plot of the residuals for the linear model, and figure 11 shows the QQ-plot of those residuals",,,,,
"The residual plot for the linear model shows that the residuals appear to be centered around the line of 0, indicating the linearity assumption holds",,,,,
"However, there does not appear to be a very even or constant spread about the line of 0, indicating that perhaps the constant variance assumption for simple linear regressions does not hold",,,,,
"Similarly, the QQ-plot in figure 11 indicates that perhaps the Gaussian assumption of normality does not hold, as there is some deviation of the standardized residuals from the theoretical quantiles near the largest and smallest theoretical quantiles",,,,,
"As such, the model does not appear to fit very well",,,,,
"It is possible that adding a quadratic term may improve the spread and the normality of the residuals, as we did notice earlier a possible underlying curve in the relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate by unit body mass for species",,,,,
"Alternatively, perhaps performing a bootstrap regression might improve the linearity given the constant variance violations",,,,,
(4) The difference in the models does appear significant as there is very large differences in prediction error between splines at lower versus higher degrees of freedom,,,,,
"Similarly, the standard errors of the models for the lower degrees of freedom are much higher those of the models with higher degrees of freedom",,,,,
"As the prediction error and standard errors for the models of higher degrees of freedom do not change much, we have relatively low uncertainty and as such can be confident in our estimates of the prediction error to say that there is a significant difference between the models",,,,,
"(5) As the residuals are centered around mean 0, but they appear to not have a constant spread, indicating that perhaps they do not depend on the metabolic rate per unit body mass, we should use a method of nonparametric bootstrapping and resample the residuals to assess uncertainty so as to prevent accidental convergence on the wrong model",,,,,
(6),,,,,
Results,,,,,
Exploratory Analysis,,,,,
"To assess whether animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans, we will use a 95% confidence interval to check if the true population coefficient of the slope of the linear regression is different from 0",,,,,
"To do such, we will test the following null and alternative hypotheses: $H_0$: $beta_1$ = 0 $H_a$: $beta_1$ $neq$ 0 The estimated slope, $beta_1$, is -26.582 Watts per gram",,,,,
This means the expected difference in the square root of the lifespan of two subjects of the same species that happen to have a square root of metabolic rate per unit body mass differing by 1 Watt per gram is -26.582 Watts per gram,,,,,
"The estimated 95% confidence interval was found to be [-30.819, -22.345], which does not include 0",,,,,
"This means that the values in the interval are values for the estimated slope, $beta_1$, that are consistent with the data and model assumptions for the prediction of the square root of the lifespan of a species based on the square root of their metabolic rate per unit body mass of the species",,,,,
"The values in this interval are unable to be rejected as plausible values for the slope given the assumptions and limitations of the model, which we assume only fails less than 5% of the time",,,,,
"As this is the case, the predicted slope of -26.582 Watts per grams falls within this interval, and as such we reject the null hypothesis that the true slope is 0 (the null that there is no relationship)",,,,,
"Similarly, the p-value of the slope is reported to be less than 2x$10^{-16}$, which also indicates a significant, negative relationship between the two",,,,,
"Given this, we can say with 95% certainty that the true relationship between square root of the lifespan of a species and square root of the metabolic rate per unit body mass is negative and linear, indicating that animals with a lower metabolic rate have longer lifespans",,,,,
(1) The crab-eating raccoon has an initial lifespan of 19 years and an initial metabolic rate of 2.588 Watts with an initial body mass of 1160 grams,,,,,
A raccoon that has a rate 50% smaller than the given rate would have a metabolic rate of 1.294 Watts,,,,,
"(2) Our model is constructed as follows: $sqrt{Lifespan}$ = -26.582  $sqrt{Metabolic Rate per Unit Body Mass}$ + 5.335 Using this model, we calculate the square root of the Lifespan of a raccoon with a body mass of 1160 grams and a metabolic rate of 1.294 Watts to be approximately 4.45 years, meaning the lifespan of the raccoon would be 19.78 years",,,,,
"(2) Finally, we performed bootstrapping to create a 95% confidence interval to test this lifespan of the raccoon",,,,,
We used the 1000 bootstrap iterations to create the interval,,,,,
"The confidence interval created was [0.005061, 5.062], which does not include the calculated value and as such we conclude that at 95% confidence, the longevity of the crab-eating raccoon calculated is not the true value as it does not fall within the interval",,,,,
(3),,,,,
Conclusions,,,,,
Exploratory Analysis,,,,,
"In summary, there appears to be an underlying negative linear relationship between metabolic rate per unit body mass and lifespan of a given species",,,,,
"(1) This means that in general, as a species metabolic rate decreases (normalized to their body mass), their life span should increase in a linear fashion",,,,,
"We cannot conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change as the value calculated did not fall within our 95% confidence interval, indicating we cannot reject the null that changing the raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would not change the lifespan of the raccoon",,,,,
"(2) As was seen in figures 10 and 11 above, there are a few violations of the linearity assumption, particularly that the residuals appear to not have a constant variance of have the error normally distributed",,,,,
"(3) As such, it is important to consider that the intervals calculated are based on a linear model that assumes these hold, when they are in fact violated, which may lead to inaccuracies in the predicted values",,,,,
