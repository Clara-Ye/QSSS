Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
We are interested in discovering what biological factors may be related to lifespan,RQDef,,,Intro,
"Given the life history of approximately 350 animals, we will study the effect of metabolic rate on overall lifespan to determine the relationship between the two (if one exists)",RQDef,DataDesc,,Intro,
"Additionally, we will look more closely at a specific animal - the crab-eating raccoon - to analyze the effect on its lifespan if we were to reduce its metabolic rate by 50% (1)",RQDef,,,Intro,
Our data is a subset of the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity,DataDesc,,,Intro,
"Although the AnAge database contains information on over 4,200 species, our collected dataset specifically contains 347 animals in the Chordata phylum",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"The data contains quantitative variables including maximum lifespan (in years), body mass (in grams), metabolic rate (in Watts), and body temperature (in Kelvin)",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"It also includes categorical variables including a unique ID for each animal (HAGRID), the common name, and the taxonomic classification",DataDesc,,,Intro,
None of the entries in our dataset have missing variables (2),DataDesc,,,Intro,
"Through extensive analysis, we determined that there exists a general negative relationship between lifespan and metabolic rate, where lower metabolic rates do generally correspond to longer lifespans",IntVar,,,Intro,
"Additionally, we found that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% resulted, with 95% confidence, in an expected lifespan of about 18.76 to 23.07 years",ResDesc,,,Intro,
"Comparatively, a crab-eating raccoon without the reduced metabolic rate would expect to have a lifespan of about 19 years",ResDesc,,,Intro,
This indicates we cannot say definitively that reducing the metabolic rate for this animal will result in an increase in lifespan (3),IntVar,,,Intro,?
Exploratory Data Analysis,Title,,,Data,
We will be working with two key variables,DataDesc,,,Data,
The first is our response variable: Lifespan,DataDesc,,,Data,
"We will be using the Maximum.longevity.yrs variable from the data, which is measured in years",DataDesc,,,Data,
We are also interested in using the metabolic rate of animals,DataDesc,,,Data,
"Due to varying body sizes, we divided the metabolic rate value (measured in Watts) provided in the dataset by the body mass (measured in grams) so that we are able to properly compare metabolic rates across all species",MethDef,MethJust,,Data,
"Henceforth, all references to Metabolic Rate will refer to this standardized quantity, which is measured in units of Watts/gram (1)",DataDesc,,,Data,?
We considered factoring in the taxonomic classification of the animals to see whether the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan differed between species,MethJust,,,Data,?
"However, we found that the distribution of data in each taxonomic class was highly variable, which would prevent us from obtaining meaningful results",MethJust,,,Data,?
"Therefore, we chose to leave out this variable in our analysis",MethDef,,,Data,?
We began our analysis by plotting a histogram of Metabolic Rate to get an idea of its distribution (Figure 1 left),Struct,,,Data,
The resulting plot was very heavily skewed left with what appeared to be several outliers,DataStat,,,Data,
The corresponding boxplot (figure not shown) confirmed the presence of these outliers,DataStat,,,Data,
"After experimenting with a number of transformations to the data, we discovered that a log transformation provided us with a much more normal looking histogram (Figure 1 right)",MethDef,MethJust,,Data,
"A normality plot (figure not shown) confirmed that this transformation had resulted in a more normal distribution, although it was still not perfect (2)",MethJust,,,Data,
"We also plotted a histogram of our response variable, Lifespan (Figure 2)",Struct,,,Data,
"Similar to Metabolic Rate, the original plot was quite heavily skewed to the left (3)",DataStat,,,Data,
We again found that applying a log transformation to this data resulted in a more normal looking curve although the corresponding normality plot (figure not shown) indicated that it was still not quite as normal as we would like,MethDef,MethJust,,Data,
"However, the transformation improved the distribution significantly",MethJust,,,Data,
"Based on our analysis of the predictor and response variables, we chose to apply log transformations to both for the rest of the analysis",MethDef,,,Data,
"Henceforth, references to these variables will refer to their log-transformed values unless otherwise noted (4)",MethDef,,,Data,
"We created a basic plot of Lifespan vs Metabolic Rate (Figure 3) (5) and noted that there appears to be a negative relationship that looks approximately linear on the right side, but seems to flatten out a bit more towards the left",DataStat,,,Data,
"Based on this, we would expect that in general, a decrease in metabolic rate results in an increase in lifespan (6)",IntVar,,,Data,
Modeling & Diagnostics,Title,,,RS,
We constructed a linear model using Metabolic Rate as the predictor since the initial plot seemed to be approximately linear,MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
We also fit five spline models with differing degrees of freedom to account for a more flexible model,MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"Specifically, we tested out degrees of freedom from 3 to 7, inclusive on the spline models",MethDef,,,RS,
"To evaluate how well each model fit the data, we used 5-fold cross-validation and mean squared error (MSE)",MethDef,,,RS,
The resulting errors are summarized in Table 1,Struct,,,RS,
We found that the model that produced the lowest error was a spline with 6 degrees of freedom (3),MethDef,,,RS,
"In Figures 4 and 5, we present the diagnostic plots for the selected spline model",Struct,,,RS,
Figure 5 plots the fitted values vs the actual values with a y=x line added which represents the case in which the fitted values exactly matched the actual values,Struct,,,RS,
We can see that the points largely follow the line with a few outliers towards end boundary,MethJust,,,RS,
This indicates that our chosen model fits the data rather well,MethJust,,,RS,
"In Figure 6, we see that the residuals appear to be randomly distributed and centered around the 0-line with constant variance",MethJust,,,RS,
There seem to be only a couple significant outliers,MethJust,,,RS,
"We also looked at a normality plot of the residuals (figure not shown), which indicated that the residuals on either end do not follow the normal distribution very closely",MethJust,,,RS,
"However, the large majority of residuals look normal enough that we can still proceed",MethJust,,,RS,
"Based on this analysis, we are not very confident in the normality of the residuals",MethJust,,,RS,
"However, given the degree of flexiblity that already exists in our model, there are no significant improvements that we could make at this point (4)",MethJust,,,RS,
"Based on the errors we displayed in Table 1, we see that they are all quite small and do not differ too much, even when we take into account the fact that we were working with the log transformation of the variables so all the values were smaller to begin with",MethJust,,,RS,
"However, when looking at the standard deviations, I found that the standard deviations for the spline models was about a power of 10 smaller than the standard deviation for the linear model",MethJust,,,RS,
"Additionally, I reran the cross-validation process a few times without a set seed and found that while the linear model consistently did worse than the spline models, the specific degrees of freedom for the best spline model varied between runs",MethJust,,,RS,
"Thus, it seems like there is a significant difference between the linear and spline model, but not between the individual spline models themselves (5)",MethJust,,,RS,
"From the residuals plot, we see that they seem randomly distributed around the 0 line",MethJust,,,RS,
"A normality plot provides further evidence that these residuals are approximately normal, although there is some deviation at the extremes",MethJust,,,RS,
"For bootstrapping, we decided to choose the nonparametric bootstrap resampling cases method because we cannot assume that the relationship between our variables is linear",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"Additionally, although the residuals do appear pretty normal, the deviation seen from the plots mildly concerns us and it's safer to assume that the residuals do not follow a given distribution, which this method of bootstrapping also allows us to do (6)",MethJust,,,RS,
Results,Title,,,RS,
"Based on the plot of our spline model (Figure 4), we can see that animals with lower metabolic rates generally do have longer lifespans (1)",ResDesc,,,RS,
"However, we do note that there is a range of metabolisms (from about -8 to -7 on the x-axis (log scale)) where the curve is relatively flat",ResDesc,,,RS,
This seems to indicate that metabolisms that fall within that range do not all have around the same lifespan and the negative relationship observed for other values is weaker or even nonexistent here,IntVar,,,RS,
"For the crab-eating raccoon specifically, their normal metabolic rate is 0.002231034 (normal scale, not log scale)",ResDesc,,,RS,
halving this results in a metabolic rate of 0.001115517,ResDesc,,,RS,
"Using the best model we identified previously (smoothing spline with 6 df), we predicted that the mean lifespan of this raccoon with half the normal metabolic rate would be around 20.78 years (2)",ResDesc,,,RS,
We used the nonparametric method of bootstrapping mentioned previously to build a 95% confidence interval for the lifespan,MethDef,,,RS,
"We ran 1000 bootstrap iterations and found a confidence interval of approximately [18.76, 23.07] (Table 2) (3)",ResDesc,MethDef,,RS,
"For reference, a crab-eating raccoon with a normal metabolic rate has a lifespan of 19 years",Context,,,RS,
"Since our confidence interval calculated includes 19, we are unable to conclude that halving the metabolic rate for this animal will definitely result in an increase in lifespan",IntVar,,,RS,
Conclusions,Title,,,Discuss,
"We conducted a thorough study on the relationship between Lifespan and Metabolic Rate and determined that a lower metabolic rate generally resulted in a longer lifespan, although this negative relationship became nearly nonexistent within a small range of metabolic rates",IntVar,,,Discuss,
"We used a spline model with 6 degrees of freedom to perform this analysis, which was chosen after testing the fit of a linear model and 5 spline models with differing degrees of freedom (1)",MethDef,MethJust,,Discuss,
We then evaluated how lowering the metabolic rate of the crab-eating raccoon would affect its lifespan and saw that our predicted value indicated an increase in lifespan of about a year,IntVar,,,Discuss,
"However, our bootstrapped 95% confidence interval included the lifespan of the raccoon with a normal metabolic rate, so we cannot conclude that reducing the metabolic rate would definitively increase the lifespan (2)",IntImp,,,Discuss,
"During our selection process for determining the best model, we only considered a linear model that took into account the metabolic rate as a predictor for Lifespan",LimAna,,,Discuss,
It's possible that there are other confounding factors that would influence Lifespan as well that we did not examine further or include in our chosen model,LimAna,,,Discuss,
"Additionally, we chose the bootstrapping method that relied on the fewest number of assumptions about the model",LimAna,,,Discuss,
"The side effect of this is that it results in a wider confidence interval than perhaps is necessary, which impacted our final conclusion about the crab-eating raccoon (3)",LimAna,,,Discuss,
