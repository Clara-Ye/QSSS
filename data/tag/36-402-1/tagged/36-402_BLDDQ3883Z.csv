Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
"Preston Jorgensen, a billionaire looking to become immortal, is interested in knowing what factors appear to be related to lifespan",Context,RQSig,,Intro,?
We are given data from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity,DataDesc,,,Intro,
"This curated database contains information for over 4,200 different species regarding their aging and life history (2)",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"Using this data, we will answer the following three questions",Struct,,,Intro,
The first being whether slowing the metabolic rate may increase lifespan,RQDef,,,Intro,
We also plan to answer whether the relationship between the metabolic rate and lifespan is nonlinear,RQDef,,,Intro,
"Lastly, using the model we construct, we will determine what the expected mean lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics, but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate (1)",RQDef,,,Intro,
"Our analysis led us to the conclusion that there is a negative relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan, meaning that a lower metabolic rate corresponds to a higher lifespan",IntVar,ResDesc,,Intro,
"Additionally, our model indicated that the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is nonlinear",ResDesc,,,Intro,
"Lastly, we predicted that the mean lifespan of an animal with the same characteristics as a crab-eating raccoon but with 50% lower metabolic rate is approximately 20.12 years (3)",ResDesc,,,Intro,
Exploratory Data Analysis,Title,,,Data,
"Using a portion of the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity dataset, we will answer the questions being asked",DataDesc,,,Data,
We define 2 key variables,Struct,,,Data,
"The first is our response variable, which we will call Lifespan",DataDesc,,,Data,
"It is the maximum longevity of the species, in years",DataDesc,,,Data,
"Our explanatory variable we will call Metabolic.by.mass, which is the amount of energy used per unit of body mass (W/g)",DataDesc,,,Data,
"This variable was calculated by dividing the typical resting metabolic rate by the typical adult body mass, which were both values provided in the AnAge database (1)",MethDef,,,Data,
This will allow comparisons between animals of different sizes,MethJust,,,Data,
"The dataset included other variables such as the kingdom of the species and their typical body temperature, but we did not identify them as necessary explanatory or confounding variables for our analysis",DataDesc,,,Data,
We will start by looking at each variable individually,Struct,,,Data,
Metabolic.by.mass and Lifespan are the two key variables that will answer Jorgensen's question,DataDesc,,,Data,
"In Figure 1 below, we see a histogram of each",Struct,,,Data,
"Lifespan, our response variable, appears to be skewed to the right with the potential for outliers (3)",DataDesc,,,Data,
"A boxplot was made for Lifespan (figure not shown), which did indicate some outliers",DataStat,MethJust,Struct,Data,?
This raises the idea that perhaps a transformation should be used on this variable,MethDef,,,Data,
"Similarly, Metabolic.by.mass also seems to be skewed to the right, with potential for outliers",DataStat,MethJust,,Data,
A boxplot for Metabolic.rate (figure not shown) also indicates some outliers (2),DataStat,MethJust,,Data,
"Therefore, it is possible that a transformation on Metabolic.by.mass should also be used",MethDef,,,Data,
"Taking a look at the normality plots (figures not shown), both Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass variables seem to have a lack of normality",DataStat,,,Data,
"Next, we explored how the variables were related to each other in order to get a better idea of how to fit models to the data",Struct,,,Data,
"Below in Figure 2, we see two scatterplots created with using explanatory and response variable (5)",Struct,,,Data,
"Looking at the first plot, using Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass, we can see that there seems to be a somewhat negative relationship between Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass",DataStat,,,Data,
"While this relationship seems slightly linear, some transformations on the variables may make the relationship appear more linear",MethJust,MethDef,,Data,?
This was also indicated in the univariate analysis of these two variables,Struct,,,Data,
"After applying a logarithmic transformation to both Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass, the scatterplot between the log transformed variables becomes much more linear, as shown in the second scatterplot in Figure 2 below (4)",MethJust,MethDef,,Data,
"As a result, we will be using log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass) in the rest of our analysis",MethDef,,,Data,
There seems to be a negative linear relationship between log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass) (6),DataStat,,,Data,
This suggests that a higher log(Metabolic.by.mass) will be associated with a lower log(Lifespan),IntVar,,,Data,
Modeling & Diagnostics,Title,,,RS,
We first constructed a linear model to fit to the data (1),MethDef,,,RS,
"We also then fit five spline models, with the effective degrees of freedom for each spline model being 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7",MethDef,,,RS,
These models (shown below) were used to answer the questions that Jorgensen asked of us,Struct,,,RS,
"It is important to note that s() indicates the nonlinear spline smoothing function (with different effective degrees of freedom, from 3 to 7, for each spline model) (2)",MethDef,,,RS,
It was clear which variables to use in the models,Other,,,RS,???
The key variables that will answer Jorgensen's questions are Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass,DataDesc,,,RS,
"However, as shown in the EDA, we log transformed both of these variables",MethDef,Struct,,RS,
"As a result, the variables that we use in the models are log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass)",DataDesc,,,RS,
"In order to determine which of the models fit best to the data, we performed 5-fold cross-validation and calculated the estimated mean squared error (MSE) and estimated standard error of the MSE",MethDef,,,RS,
The MSE and standard error estimated for each model after performing 5-fold cross-validation are shown below,Struct,,,RS,
"The first number represents the MSE estimates, and the second number represents the standard error estimates",Struct,,,RS,
It is clear that the spline models have much lower MSE estimates than the linear model,MethJust,,,RS,
We decided that the best model was the spline model with 5 effective degrees of freedom because it had the lowest MSE (3),MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"However, based on the uncertainty in your estimates of the prediction error, the difference between models does not seem very significant (for the spline models only)",MethJust,,,RS,
"This is because not only did the spline models have very close prediction error estimates, they also had very close estimated standard errors (5)",MethJust,,,RS,
"Next, we look at the model diagnostics of our chosen model and how well it appears to fit",Struct,,,RS,
"Fitting the spline model to our log transformed variables (shown in Figure 4), it seems that that it mostly captures the trend of the data points",MethJust,,,RS,
"Because the assumptions for linear smoothers are the same as for simple linear regression, we will use the the same diagnostic plots that we would use for linear regression to check the assumptions",MethJust,MethDef,,RS,
"Below in Figure 3, we see residuals plots and a qq-plot of the residuals",Struct,,,RS,
"It appears that in the residuals plots, the residuals are centered around 0, so there does not seem to a violation of the linearity assumption",MethJust,,,RS,
"However, in the plot of residuals against our explanatory variable, the residuals seem to be more spread out at the lower values of log(Metabolic.by.mass)",MethJust,,,RS,? (limitation)
This indicates a possible violation of the constant variance assumption,MethJust,,,RS,?
"There is also a small possibility of a violation of the Gaussian noise assumption, as there is a little bit of deviation from the straight line in the qq-plot at both ends of the plot",MethJust,,,RS,?
"It is possible that other nonlinear transformations of our variables (Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass) could result in residuals that do not have indications of assumption violations (specifically constant variance and Gaussian noise assumptions), but we chose log transformation because it seemed to be the best choice for fitting our models to our data (4)",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"From our residual diagnostic plots, it seems that bootstrapping by resampling cases is the most appropriate choice for our data",MethDef,,,RS,
"This is because the residuals plots lack homoscedasticity, and the qq-plot indicates a possible violation of the residuals' normality (6)",MethJust,,,RS,
Results,Title,,,RS,
"As requested by Jorgensen, we will use our spline model to determine whether animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans",RQDef,MethDef,,RS,
"In order to do this, we again look at our spline curve with our plotted data points",Struct,,,RS,
"As seen from the plot in Figure 4 below, the spline curve is always decreasing, suggesting a negative relationship between log(Lifespan) and log(Metabolic.by.mass), which in turn suggests a negative relationship between Lifespan and Metabolic.by.mass",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Therefore, our model and data indicate that animals with lower metabolic rates have longer lifespans (1)",IntVar,,,RS,
"Additionally, as requested by Jorgensen, we use our model to estimate the mean lifespan of animal with the characteristics of a crab-eating raccoon but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate",RQDef,,,RS,
"After taking into account the key characteristic variables (Metabolic.rate, Body.mass.g, and Metabolic.by.mass), applying the proper log transformations, and using our model, we estimate the mean lifespan of an animal with these characteristics to be 20.12 years (2)",ResDesc,MethDef,,RS,MethDef?
"We also constructed a 95% confidence interval for this mean lifespan, using the pivotal confidence interval and 1000 bootstrap iterations (bootstrap by resampling cases)",MethDef,,,RS,
"The resulting 95% pivotal confidence interval was [18.20, 22.21]",ResDesc,,,RS,
"That is, one can expect the mean lifespan of an animal with the same characteristics as a crab-eating raccoon but with a 50% smaller metabolic rate to be between 18.20 and 22.21 years (3)",IntVar,,,RS,
Conclusions,Title,,,Discuss,
"In this study, we used a smoothing spline to examine the relationship between the metabolic rate of animals and their lifespan",RQDef,MethDef,,Discuss,
"Analyzing the portion of data from the AnAge database with our model, we concluded that there is a negative relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan",ResDesc,DataDesc,,Discuss,
This means that a lower metabolic rate corresponded to a higher lifespan (1),IntVar,,,Discuss,
"Moreover, we concluded that this relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan was nonlinear",ResDesc,IntVar,,Discuss,?
"Lastly, we used our model to find that the mean lifespan of an animal with the crab-eating raccoon’s characteristics but a 50% smaller metabolic rate is 20.12 years, with a pivotal confidence interval of [18.20, 22.21]",ResDesc,IntVar,,Discuss,?
"However, Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change",IntImp,,,Discuss,
"We cannot conclude a direct causation effect, only association between metabolic rate and lifespan",IntImp,LimAna,,Discuss,LimAna?
There may be confounding variables that were not including in our dataset,LimData,IntImp,,Discuss,
"As a result, Jorgensen cannot conclude that reducing the crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to change (2)",IntImp,,,Discuss,
Our analysis had limitations that might affect our conclusions,Struct,,,Discuss,?
"One limitation is that our model's residuals lacked homoscedasticity, and there were also signs that our residuals may not be normal",LimAna,,,Discuss,
"These problems indicate that our model assumptions may be violated, which in turn means that our conclusions may be affected",LimAna,,,Discuss,
"Our analysis could also be improved with more data on the animals, as it is possible that there is a confounding variable influencing the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan (3)",LimData,,,Discuss,FuWork?
