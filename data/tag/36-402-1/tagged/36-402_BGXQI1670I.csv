1 Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
Understanding the lifespan of animals is a fundamental question in all of biology,RQSig,,,Intro,
What determines how long an animal will live,RQDef,,,Intro,?
Why do some animals live more than others,RQDef,,,Intro,?
Are there specific characteristics of animals that make them able to live longer,RQDef,,,Intro,?
"Given a set of attributes for an animal, how accurately can we predict its lifespan",RQDef,,,Intro,?
(2) The AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity provides the dataset aimed at answering and discovering more insights related to these questions,DataDesc,,,Intro,
"Specifically, this source contains an entire database of the life history and aging of animals, providing for each species variables such as lifespan, age of sexual maturity, adult body mass, typical body temperature, and metabolic rate",DataDesc,,,Intro,
"(1) In this study, we are interested in determining whether a relationship exists between metabolic rate and lifespan, and if so, would a linear relationship or a nonlinear fit be the best to characterize the relationship",RQDef,,,Intro,
"Furthermore, we would like to use our proposed model to estimate the confidence interval for the mean lifespan of a raccoon experiencing a 50% decrease in metabolic rate",RQDef,,,Intro,
"(3) After an extensive study on various models and metrics, we have discovered that animals with lower metabolic rates do in fact have a longer lifespan on average, and that the relationship between metabolic rate and average lifespan is not linear",ResDesc,,,Intro,
"By transforming metabolic rate and average lifespan, though, we were able to see a linear relationship between them",MethDef,ResDesc,,Intro,
"In addition, using our proposed model, we can be 95% confident that the average lifespan of a crab-eating raccoon (_Procyon cancrivorus_, HAGRID = 1898) with a 50% smaller metabolic rate lies between 19.05 and 23.78 years",ResDesc,,,Intro,?
2 Exploratory Data Analysis,Title,,,Data,
2.1 Data,Title,,,Data,
"The data being used comes from the AnAge Database of Animal Ageing and Longevity, providing information compiled from hundreds of scientific papers for thousands of species",DataDesc,,,Data,
"The data contains information for 347 animals, specifically from the Chordata phylum, or animals that have a spinal cord",DataDesc,,,Data,
"Data collected for each animal included the Kingdom of the animal (taxonomic classification for a species), common name of the animal, maximum longevity in years (`Maximum.longevity.yrs`), body mass in grams (`Body.mass.g`), metabolic rate in Watts (`Metabolic.rate`), and typical body temperature in Kelvin (`Temperature`)",DataDesc,,,Data,
2.2 Exploration,Title,,,Data,
"We begin our exploration by analyzing the univariate distributions of each of the predictor variables, as well as the response variable (`Maximum.longevity.yrs`)",Struct,,,Data,
"(1) First, we create a new variable called `Metabolic.by.mass`, defined as our original `Metabolic.rate` divided by our original `Body.mass.g`, that we will use as our metabolic rate for the rest of the report",MethDef,,,Data,
"(2, 3) From Figure 1, we notice that a handful of variables of interest in our data set, specifically `Metabolic.by.mass` (one of our predictor variables) and `Maximum.longevity.yrs` (our response variable), are strongly right skewed",DataStat,,,Data,
Roughly 90% of the animals in our data set will have a maximum longevity of less than 30 years and a metabolic rate (using the formula we previously described) of less than 0.01,DataStat,,,Data,
This is important as we develop our models because this may invite us to look into transformations on these particular variables and pay attention more closely to the assumptions of relevant models,MethJust,,,Data,
2.3 Transformations,Title,,,Data,
"(5) Because of the discovered right-skewness on several variables of interest detailed in the previous section and in Figure 2, a log-transformation was performed across all the variables in attempt to make more of the variables more normal and relationships among them more linear",MethDef,MethJust,,Data,
We thus appended `.log` to the end of each of the variables,MethDef,,,Data,?
"The transformations we made are particularly encouraging because from Figure 3, our response variable, `Maximum.longevity.yrs.log`, looks much more normally distributed from its density plot",MethJust,,,Data,
"Furthermore, several of our predictor variables like `Metabolic.by.mass.log` and `Body.mass.g.log` also appear much more normal as a result of the transformations",MethJust,,,Data,
We can also see that the relationship between the variables are starting to look more linear as a result of the transformations,MethJust,,,Data,
"(4) We see a moderate negative linear relationship between `Metabolic.by.mass.log` and `Maximum.longevity.yrs.log`, having an $R^2$ value of -0.585, which originally did not look linear and looked more like a power law relationship",MethJust,DataStat,,Data,
(6) One important observations is that there does appear to be two clusters of points from looking at the relationships of `Metabolic.by.mass.log` and `Body.mass.log.g` and `Temperature.log`,DataStat,,,Data,???
"Thus, the lower $R^2$ may actually be hiding the fact that `Metabolic.by.mass.log` and these other variables are linearly related, and we should focus on using it alone to avoid any multicollinearity issues further one",DataStat,,,Data,???
"For instance, in the `Body.mass.g.log` vs `Metabolic.by.mass.log` plot, we can clearly see a large cluster of a negative linear relationship and a less sparse negative linear relationship under it",DataStat,,,Data,
These clusters may be useful to pay attention to and remember later on when we move on to the Modeling part of our report,IntVar,,,Data,?
3 Modeling & Diagnostics,Title,,,RS,
"As we are constructing our regression models, we remember to choose the one that is the most accurate and interpretable in order to best explain patterns in the data",MethJust,,,RS,???
(1) We began by fitting a linear model with our log-transformed variables to predict `Maximum.longevity.yrs.log` from `Metabolic.by.mass.log`,MethDef,,,RS,
"We choose to fit based off of only `Metabolic.by.mass.log` because from the EDA, this variable had a decently strong enough correlation with the other variables so we should be cautious and only select this one variable to fit with our models in order to avoid any multicollinearity issues",MethJust,MethDef,,RS,
"Looking at the plot of our transformed points back in Figure 3, it appears that the cluster of points that we observed in our EDA could potentially be skewing our results in our linear regression",MethJust,,,RS,
"More precisely, it seems as if all the points that have `Metabolic.by.mass.log <= 7` follow less of a negative linear relationship than the points that have `Metabolic.by.mass.log >= 7`",MethJust,,,RS,
"Thus we note that even though this linear model we have fit is satisfactory, we are not satisfied as we would probably want to select some model complex enough to account for these slight discrepancies we noticed in the EDA",MethJust,,,RS,
"After fitting our simple linear regression model, we moved on to explore using smoothing splines to leverage the power and flexibility that these more complex models afford us",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,?
"(2) Again, we use our log-transformed variables to fit a smoothing spline to predict `Maximum.longevity.yrs.log` from `Metabolic.by.mass.log` using degrees of freedom ranging from 3 to 7",MethDef,,,RS,
"Our EDA showed us this was the best variable to predict the longevity, and so we fit our models using solely that variable",MethJust,MethDef,,RS,?
We then utilized a 5-fold cross-validation procedure in order to see which model would have the lowest cross-validation average mean-squared errors and if the standard errors seemed reasonable,MethJust,,,RS,
(3) Table 1 summarizes our findings for the average 5-fold cross-validation mean-squared error for each of the six different models we tried,Struct,,,RS,
"From the table, we notice there is a pretty big drop off in going from a simple linear regression model to a smoothing spline in terms of MSE by roughly 0.01",MethJust,,,RS,
This gives us evidence that choosing the spline model as our selected model may be more promising than sticking with simple linear regression,MethDef,,,RS,
"As we increase the degrees of freedom in our spline model from 3 to 7, we notice that the MSE's decrease until it hits a trough at 6, and then increases after that",MethJust,,,RS,
"(5) The difference between the models in terms of the uncertainty estimates do not appear to be significant because the uncertainty in standard errors for the smoothing splines differ by about 1% for every change of 1 degree of freedom, with the linear regression standard error not too far off from the smoothing spline with degree of freedom 3",MethJust,,,RS,
"Ultimately, we choose the smoothing spline model with 6 degrees of freedom as it had the lowest MSE of 0.3509 and a comparatively low standard error of 0.0190",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
One potential problem with the models relates to the two cluster of points we noted in our EDA between `Metabolic.by.mass.log` and `Maximum.longevity.yrs.log`,LimAna,,,RS,?
We note that it seems like some points above a certain threshold appear very flat and so may perhaps be a different group animals and thus will need a different method from the others in predicting their average lifespan,LimAna,,,RS,?
This may skew the results by trying to predict animals from two different clusters or try to predict an animal using another cluster that it is not in,LimAna,,,RS,?
"Thus the averaging may potentially hide a stronger effect that is truly there, but is not fully manifested because of the animals in different clusters being mixed together",LimAna,,,RS,?
"(4) In Figure 4 below, we display the diagnostic plots related to our smoothing spline with 6 degrees of freedom",Struct,,,RS,
"Looking at the plots, the models do appear to fit well",MethJust,,,RS,
"If we look at the plot on the left, the points appear to be patternlessly scattered about $x=0$ and so there are seems to be no huge problems related to homoscedasticity",MethJust,,,RS,
"If we look at the plot on the right, we see that the points on the qq-plot are close to the line with the exception of a few points near the edges, but for the most part, these points do not appear to violate the normality assumption here",MethJust,,,RS,
"(6) Because the residual diagnostic plots look good, resampling residuals appears to be the most appropriate route to take because the plots do not appear to violate homoscedasticity and there does not seem to be strong normality violations from the diagnostic plots",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
4 Results,Title,,,RS,
"(1) As requested by Preston Jorgensen, we do find evidence with our selected model that animals with lower metabolic rates do have longer lifespans",ResDesc,,,RS,
"In Figure 5 above, we fit our selected smoothing spline model with 6 degrees of freedom to the log-transformed dataset",MethDef,,,RS,
"We note that for `Metabolic.by.mass.log` going from -10 to -7, the spline predicts the `Maximum.longevity.yrs.log` to slightly decrease, albeit very slowly, and then once the `Metabolic.by.mass.log` reaches -7, the spline linearly decreases after that",ResDesc,,,RS,
"This again may point to the fact that we have the two clusters of points as previously mentioned in our EDA, but still provides the relevant evidence to Preston's claim",LimAna,,,RS,???
"Using the selected model, we are interested in estimating the mean lifespan for a crab-eating raccoon (_Procyon cancrivorus_, HAGRID = 1898) if its metabolic rate were reduced by 50%",RQDef,,,RS,?
"in this case, that would reduce its `Metabolic.by.mass` from 0.0022 to 0.0011",ResDesc,,,RS,
"(2) Using our selected model, we would estimate its mean lifespan with those characteristics to be 20.78 in years",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Originally, the mean lifespan of the raccoon without the reduction in metabolic rate is 19 years",ResDesc,,,RS,
Thus this would amount to almost a 9% increase in added average lifespan for this raccoon,IntVar,,,RS,?
"Furthermore, we were also interested in deriving a 95% confidence interval for the specific quantity we estimated above -- the mean lifespan of the raccoon with 50% reduced metabolic rate",RQDef,,,RS,???
"As discussed previously, because the residual diagnostics for our model did not appear to show any blatant violations, we used the resample residuals technique to bootstrap",MethDef,MethJust,,RS,
"(3) Using a pivotal confidence interval with 1000 bootstrap iterations, we find the 95% confidence interval for this particular quantity is [19.05, 23.78]",ResDesc,MethDef,,RS,
This would mean that if we would be 95% confident that a raccoon with its metabolic rate reduced by 50% would have an average lifespan between 19.05 years and 23.78 years,IntVar,,,RS,?
"We note that the lower bound for this confidence interval is greater than the original average mean lifespan of 19, so the reduction in metabolic rate does seem to be fruitful in reducing the average lifespan for the raccoon",IntVar,,,RS,
The model would in fact support the conclusion that reducing the metabolic rate would cause this particular increase in the mean lifespan of an animal,IntVar,,,RS,
5 Conclusions,Title,,,Discuss,
"In conclusion, understanding the factors that influence an animals lifespan continues to be an important and fundamental question in science",RQSig,RQDef,,Discuss,?
"After this analysis, we hope that Preston Jorgensen can understand the the factors influencing average lifespan better",IntImp,,,Discuss,?
"(1) In summary, we find that the relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan is not linear, but there does seem to be a negative relationship between the two variables",ResDesc,,,Discuss,
"After applying transformations to the variables, we were able to find a more linear relationship between the two",ResDesc,MethDef,,Discuss,
"(2) Furthermore, we were able to help Preston Jorgensen conclude that reducing a crab-eating raccoon's metabolic rate by 50% would cause its lifespan to increase by nearly 9%, with the lower bound for our 95% interval we were predicting the average lifespan to be greater than the original average lifespan",ResDesc,IntVar,,Discuss,?
"(3) Finally, we note strongly that this analysis was limited to solely the Chordata phylum, and so one would have to do more analysis with other groups of animals in order to generalize our assertion about the negative relationship between metabolic rate and lifespan",LimAna,,,Discuss,LimData?
Another assumption that may be broken with additional data is the homoscedasticity and normality assumptions we made when fitting the model,LimAna,,,Discuss,
"It can very likely be the case that if we were to add more animal groups, these assumptions may be broken with more clusters of animals added",LimAna,,,Discuss,
"Because our analysis hinted at there being several clusters of animals that may need different models fit, we also note that there might not be one blanket model that works best for all the animals -- perhaps several models need to be combined in some way to analyze more groups more efficiently",LimAna,,,Discuss,
