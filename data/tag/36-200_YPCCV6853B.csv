Introduction: Forest fires are an ever-present danger not only to our nature reservations and wildlife but also to residents and their residencies.,,,
"Just this year (2020), California had a record-setting year of wildfires (Alonso and Sanchez, 2020), burning nearly one million acres in a month.",,,
"In order to successfully restrain these fires, we must understand the underlying causes and factors that change how effective the fires are.",,,
"With the information we obtain from this, we can help turn forests that would spread a bigger fire into forests that wouldn’t spread such a big fire, or at the very least outline areas of forests at major risk and provide more safety precautions.",,,
"Data: For this investigation, we have data on 517 different forest fires on the site of Montesinho natural park in Portugal, and we are given several variables including the area of forest burned, the month and day of the fire, the FFMC, DMC, DC, ISI, temperature, and several other factors.",,,
"For this particular study, we will observe the correlation between the area burned and the FFMC, DMC, and temperature.",,,
The main variable we will be comparing other variables to is the area of the forest burned.,,,
This is a quantitative variable measured in hectares that represents the amount of forest burned in the instance of a specific fire.,,,
"The average number of hectares burned in one instance of a fire at Montesinho is 12.895, whereas the median is 0.520.",,,
This means that the data is more skewed to the right.,,,
"If we examine the data, we see there is one instance recording 1090 hectares of forest burned, explaining the wide difference between mean and median, as well as highlighting our outlier.",,,
"The FFMC refers to the Fine Fuel Moisture Code, which is described as “the fuel moisture of forest litter under the shade of a forest canopy” by the National Wildlife Coordinating Group.",,,
"If we examine the histogram, we see that the graph is unimodal and resembles a bell-shaped curve towards the right side.",,,
"We find that there exists an outlier of 18, but that the rest of the data conforms with the statistical trend.",,,
"The DMC refers to the Duff Moisture Code, which is described as the “fuel moisture of decomposed organic material underneath the litter” by the NWCG.",,,
"If we examine the histogram, we see that the graph is bimodal.",,,
"Most of the data is concentrated around 80-140, but there are still noteworthy amounts of instances with DMC ranging from 0 to 240.",,,
The temperature refers to the temperature when a specific forest fire occurs.,,,
"The mean and the median are very close in value, meaning the graph would be symmetrical.",,,
The histogram demonstrates a unimodal distribution.,,,
Research Scenarios: How the Fine Fuel Moisture Code relates to the area of forest burned.,,,
Our first question will aim to find the relationship between the strength of a forest fire and the specific Fine Fuel Moisture Code.,,,
"Logically, the more fuel moisture of litter in one area of the forest canopy, the stronger the fire would be simply because more fuel equals a bigger fire.",,,
"If the FFMC goes up, then the area of forest burned would also go up because fuel moisture of litter would help the fire grow.",,,
"However, we hope to find a specific correlation in order to determine how big a factor the FFMC actually is the size of a forest fire.",,,
"Because we have two quantitative variables to compare, we can create a scatterplot and a correlation table to find the correlation.",,,
"Given the correlation coefficient of 0.040, we know that there is a very slight positive correlation, meaning that as the FFMC increases, the area of the forest fire also increases, albeit very slightly.",,,
"Although there doesn’t exist a very strong correlation, this may be due to the fact that there are many other factors that also affect how big forest fire is, and those factors could easily overwhelm the FFMC if they work against it.",,,
"In conclusion, my hypothesis that the forest fire size would increase based on the increase of FFMC is correct, although it would not cause a big increase.",,,
How the Duff Moisture Code relates to the area of forest burned.,,,
Our second question aims to find the correlation between the strength of a forest fire and the Duff Moisture Code.,,,
"Logically, the more fuel moisture of the organic material underneath the litter, the stronger the fire would be and the bigger area it would burn through.",,,
"Therefore, if the Duff Moisture Code goes up, the area of forest burned would increase because the fuel moisture of the organic material would boost the fire.",,,
"Because we have two quantitative variables, we again create a scatter plot and correlation table.",,,
"From this scatter plot, we are given a regression equation of approximately 4.8 + .07x.",,,
"With a correlation value of 0.073, we again see a weak positive correlation.",,,
"However, this is almost double the correlation coefficient that exists between the FFMC and the area.",,,
"This means that although the correlation between DMC and the area of forest fire isn’t strong, there is still a positive relationship: as the DMC value goes up, so does the average area.",,,
"In conclusion, my hypothesis that as the DMC goes up, the area would also go up is correct, albeit a small increase.",,,
Our third question looks to find the correlation between the temperature and the area of forest burned.,,,
"Logically, the hotter a particular area is, the easier it would be to spread fire in that area, simply because fire spreads better when it is hotter outside and spreads slower when it is colder.",,,
"Because we have two quantitative variables, we again create a scatter plot and correlation table.",,,
"With a correlation coefficient of 0.098, we see the highest correlation between these values.",,,
"However, given the ideal correlation coefficient for a perfectly positive correlation is 1, we know that the correlation still isn’t that strong.",,,
"However, this information still supports my hypothesis, demonstrating that as temperature goes up, the average area burned by the forest fire also goes up.",,,
Discussion: The goal of this study was to find a correlation between different factors and how strong a forest fire is.,,,
"From the information we analyzed, we see that FFMC, DMC, and temperature all have a positive correlation with the area of forest burned.",,,
"The correlation between these individual variables and the area burned all were relatively low, but that is to be expected due to the many factors contributing to how big forest fire is.",,,
"However, there are certain variables that will more closely correlate with the size of the fire, because from the data we analyzed we observed a closer connection between the area of forest burned and temperature than between area of forest burned and DMC, and both were more closely correlated than FFMC.",,,
"With this information, we can more closely observe conditions that more closely correlate with the area of forest burned, placing more emphasis on factors like temperature and DMC than FFMC.",,,
"Through the analysis of this data, it would be easier to predict whether or not a forest fire will occur, and how big it would get.",,,
"Overall, this information should make it easier to predict when a forest fire will become a problem.",,,
