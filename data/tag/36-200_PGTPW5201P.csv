Introduction Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.,,,
Some individuals are at a higher risk of having heart disease due to certain genetic and environmental factors.,,,
Insurance companies often use medical history records to predict which individuals are more likely to require support for medical conditions like heart disease related complications in the future.,,,
They charge higher premiums to those who are predicted to have further heart disease-related issues.,,,
This examination looks at the relationship between certain medical history factors during a period related to heart disease and the cost of insurance claims.,,,
The work may help insurance companies determine premium rates for individuals who are at higher risk of having heart disease related issues later on in life.,,,
Data The data was collected from 788 insurance subscribers who were treated for ischemic heart disease from the period January 1998 to December 1999.,,,
The medical histories of the subscribers were provided in the information given in this examination.,,,
Our main focus is on the cost variable.,,,
Cost is a quantitative variable that measures the total cost (measured in US dollars) of the insurance claim by subscribers after their treatment for ischemic heart disease for the period noted above.,,,
The mean cost was $2799.956 and the standard deviation of the cost was $6690.26.,,,
The research questions (stated in the next section) will also include interventions and complications.,,,
Interventions is a quantitative variable and complications is a categorical variable.,,,
The number of interventions is the total number of interventions or procedures carried out during the time period of January 1998 to December 1999 for the subscriber.,,,
The mean number of interventions was 4.707 and the standard deviation for interventions was 5.595.,,,
Complications were split into two categories: yes (1) if the subscriber had complications and no (0) if the subscriber did not have any complications.,,,
"A total of 745 subscribers did not have any complications, while 43 subscribers did have complications as shown in the bar graph below.",,,
Characterizing Cost Distribution The first research question is to characterize the distribution of the total cost of claims by subscribers.,,,
"We hypothesize that most subscribers will be on the lower end of the cost scale, and there will be fewer individuals who have higher total costs because we postulate that higher costs are associated with the use of more resources, time, and money due to extrenuating medical circumstance.",,,
"As shown in the histogram (figure 2, below), it can be observed that most individuals had total costs ranging from $0 to $526.648 (402 subscribers).",,,
"The histogram is heavily skewed right, meaning that the tail of the graph is shown on the right side.",,,
A majority of subscribers are shown to have paid less on the range of cost.,,,
There are outliers towards the right of the graph where subscribers have paid extremely large amounts.,,,
"The five-number data table summary of cost distribution (table 1, above) shows that the minimum cost was $0 and the maximum cost was $52664.90, indicated that the range of cost was also $52664.90.",,,
The interquartile range is $1763.55.,,,
Only 25% of subscribers had a total cost between $1924.6 and $52664.90.,,,
"From this data in figure 1 and table 2, we can determine that most subscribers had costs on the lower end of the range and only a few individual outliers had costs of over $10,000.",,,
"From the histogram in figure 2, we can conclude that insurance claims are often on the lower end of the range.",,,
We can see that there are a few number of outliers that have very large total cost of claims during the period that could be due to a variety of factors.,,,
"Generally, insurance companies can note that most subscribers tend to have lower cost claims that range between $0 and $5,000, with even more individuals included in the range up to $10,000.",,,
Anything above that range is extreme and quite rare as shown above.,,,
"Therefore, our initial position was supported by the data shown in both figure 2 and table 1.",,,
"The Relationship Between Interventions and Cost Since the number of interventions and procedures is likely associated with higher usage of medical care resources, we can hypothesize that a higher number of interventions will result in a higher cost of claim to the insurance company by the subscriber.",,,
The second question in this examination is to investigate whether interventions are associated with an increase in cost.,,,
Figure 3 displays the relationship between cost and number of Interventions for the subscriber.,,,
Most of the data is concentrated towards the bottom left of the graph.,,,
"However, a slight positive linear relationship between the data can be observed.",,,
"As the number of interventions increases (especially towards the right of the graph where interventions>20), cost increases as well.",,,
"Figure 3 also shows the linear and smooth fit models with positive slopes, indicated the positive relationship between interventions and cost.",,,
Table 2 provides relevant information on the regression of interventions on cost.,,,
This is for the linear fit of the line in figure 3.,,,
The slope of the line is $869.0756/intervention.,,,
"However, the standard error is $29.2988 in this case.",,,
This larger standard error indicated variability in the spread of the data and relationship to the linear regression made.,,,
"From this data, we can conclude that there is a slight positive relationship between the number of intervention and the total cost of claims.",,,
The data in the scatter plot and linear regression of interventions on cost shows this positive relationship.,,,
"However, there is a larger standard error and there are many points that stray far from the linear and smoothed fit curves in figure 3.",,,
"Thus, we cannot make such a clear cut conclusion.",,,
"However, the data generally supports out hypothesis that more interventions and procedures is associated with a higher total cost of claim by the subscriber for the period for the insurance company.",,,
Cost Depending on Complications The third question is to determine whether having complications is associated with higher costs.,,,
"Table 3 shows that the mean cost for subscribers who did not have any complications was $2491.607, which is significantly lower than the mean cost of $8142.284 for subscribers who did have complications.",,,
"As complications mean that the subscriber tends to be worse of medically, we can postulate that it may take more medical resources to treat them.",,,
"Thus, we hypothesize that subscribers who have reported complications have generally higher total costs of claims that those who have not reported complications.",,,
The boxplot (figure 4) created for the data generally supports our hypothesis that complications are associated with higher total costs.,,,
"However, we must take into account the large number of outliers (mentioned in next segment) for the no complications that can change the conclusion.",,,
"Discussion The analysis in this examination focused on cost, and its relationship between other medical history related variables including interventions, and complications using data from 788 insurance subscribers during the period from January 1998 to December 1999.",,,
"Overall, we found that the data for total cost of claims by subscriber is skewed right meaning that most of the subscribers made claims that were on the lower end of the range.",,,
"As a result, insurance companies should note that generally subscribers make lower cost claims for heart disease during a period unless there are outliers that may be as a result of a variety of extrenuating circumstance factors.",,,
We saw a slight positive relationship between number of interventions and cost.,,,
"However, the linear fit had a high standard error and there may be other factors that resulted in higher costs.",,,
There were also outliers showing that individuals with few interventions still had high costs so the association between the two is not strong and definitive.,,,
"Additionally, we saw a slight association between cost and subscribers with complications and subscribers without complications.",,,
"However, we must take into account the way the 0 (no) complications boxplot was created with many outliers.",,,
The outlier data that stretched towards high costs was not included in the drawing of the interquartile range and box structure data.,,,
We cannot be sure as a result because we see that some of the highest costs were part of the outliers with no complication.,,,
"Therefore, insurance companies should note that we can see slight associations between higher interventions and complications (yes) and higher costs, but there may be other factors influencing cost claims as well.",,,
"In the future, our goal is to analyze more factors that may influence the cost of the insurance claims during the period.",,,
"We could examine variables such as age, income, location, gender, that could all impact the way heart disease affects the medical treatment and thus, cost claims of subscribers.",,,
"Overall, our examination may help insurance companies understand what factors result in high cost claims for individuals with heart disease and help them plan future premium rates for those subscribers.",,,
