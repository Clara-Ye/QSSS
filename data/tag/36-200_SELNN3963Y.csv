Forest fires are always started in one of two ways: naturally caused or human-caused.,,,
But natural forest fire constitutes the majority of areas burned because human-caused fires are generally detected early in their duration.,,,
"Wildfires, however, could burn for hours before caught by firefighting authorities.",,,
"With the limitation of sample data, this study will mainly focus on the cause and effect of fires and how can the data analysis help firefighters to gain better information regarding the pattern of forest fires and land management (this website provides some basic information regarding forest fire, their control and monitoring https://www.globalforestwatch.org/topics/fires/#intro).",,,
The data set in this study includes 517 forest fires.,,,
"The primary focus of this study is to analyze the relationship between the cause, effect, and frequency of the fires; therefore, the frequency of fires in each month is essential to this study.",,,
The mean of forest fires per month is 43.10.,,,
Another variable important to this study is the drought code.,,,
"The mean of drought code is 547.94, with September having the highest mean grouped by month of 734.62 and April having the lowest mean grouped by month of 48.56.",,,
The median drought code is 664.20.,,,
"Since the mean is less resistant to exceptional values than the median, and the median is higher than the mean in this data set, we could deduce that most of the months have high values of drought code, but a few months have very low drought code.",,,
"Lastly, temperature is another variable considered in this study.",,,
"The mean temperature is 18.89 Celsius, ranging from a minimum of 2.20 and a maximum of 33.30 degrees.",,,
Distribution of Forest Fire During the Year The first research question is about the frequency of fire in different months of the year.,,,
"Based on assumptions about temperature and humidity, we hypothesize forest fire happens the most often during the summer, specifically June, July, and August.",,,
"Based on the following frequency bar graph for categorical data, we can observe that the most frequent months for forest fires are August and September, with March following along.",,,
This observation does not fully correspond with our hypothesis.,,,
"However, June, July, and August are on the higher side of the count.",,,
"To further analyze the data, the relative frequency for August and September is 36% and 33%, while the mean relative frequency for each month is 8.3%.",,,
"As a result, the data demonstrates the frequency of fire is significantly higher in August and September.",,,
"To explore the reason for these phenomena, we will examine temperature and drought code data, which are the leading causes of forest fires.",,,
Relationship between Drought Code and Month of the Year Drought conditions sometimes develop after a period of above-average amounts of rainfall over an extended area.,,,
"When this happens, the wet conditions have encouraged more plants and trees to grow and gain nutrients.",,,
These new plants and shallow-rooted trees are the first to start to wilt when dry conditions begin.,,,
"If the dry conditions persist, a drought can develop, leading to conditions favorable for wildfires as all the excess dried-out vegetation provides ample fuel for the fires.",,,
"The Drought Code (DC) is a numeric rating of the average moisture content of deep, compact organic layers.",,,
This code is a useful indicator of seasonal drought effects on forest fuels and smoldering in deep duff layers and large logs.,,,
"To find out why forest fires happen during August and September and provide useful information regarding fire causes for firefighters, we made a box plot of DC grouped by month.",,,
The following figure illustrates that August (Grey) and September (Yellow) have one of the highest Drought Codes.,,,
"The median of August DC is 647.1, with the highest outlier reaching a maximum of 819.1.",,,
"For September, the median DC is even higher than August, resulting in 728.6.",,,
"Its upper fence reached 860.6, which is the highest DC in the entire data set.",,,
"However, there is some insufficiency from this relationship between the drought and the month of the year because June, July, and October also have a relatively high DC.",,,
"Still, their forest fires are significantly less from Figure 1.",,,
"To examine other factors that cause forest fires, we came up with our third research question.",,,
Correlation Between Temperature and Fire Initial Speed Heat is another critical cause of forest fires.,,,
This section will investigate the relationship between temperature and month of the year to continue exploring the reason for high fire frequency in August and September.,,,
"Moreover, we will also examine the correlation between temperature and fire initial speed because, as I mentioned in the introduction, naturally caused forest fires tend to burn for hours before discovery, causing extensive damage.",,,
"Therefore, if firefighters can start the rescue process in the early stage of the burn, which will reduce the damage to forests.",,,
"In the box plot shown below, the data demonstrates that August and September have one of the highest temperatures, which further explains their high frequency of forest fire.",,,
"The median temperature of August is 21.25 degrees, with the maximum outlier reaching 33.3 degrees.",,,
"For September, the median temperature is 19.6, and the hottest day reached 30.2.",,,
"Not only do August and September have high temperatures, an interesting phenomenon shown in the box plot is that they also have the most significant difference between their min and max.",,,
One reason for this discrepancy could be the different locations of each forest fire.,,,
Wildfires can occur anywhere but are common in the forested areas of the United States and Canada.,,,
"They are also susceptible in many places around the world, including much of the vegetated areas of Australia as well as in the Western Cape of South Africa (https://www.weatherwizkids.com/weather-wildfire.htm#:~:text=Wildfires%20can%20occur%20anywhere%2C%20but,Western%20Cape%20of%20South%20Africa.).",,,
"For example, in colder areas such as Canada, its temperature might be on the lower end of the spectrum.",,,
"In areas closer to the equator, their temperature might be on the higher end of the spectrum.",,,
"Since there is a clear relationship between the temperature of the month and the frequency of forest fire, we can conclude from this box plot that there is a positive correlation between temperature and fire frequency.",,,
"We have investigated the causes of the fires: drought code and temperature, and we understand their positive correlation with the frequency of fires; our next step is to connect the cause of fire with the effect of fire.",,,
The initial speed of the fire is an essential factor in measuring damage and the rescue process.,,,
"In the following figure, we graphed a scatterplot of temperature and Initial Speed Index (ISI) and added the linear regression line to indicate the correlation between the two factors.",,,
The graph below shows a reasonably linear regression line and a positive correlation with the correlation efficient at 0.50.,,,
The intercept of the linear regression line is 14.36 degrees at ISI 0.,,,
Most of the fires happen between 5 to 30 degrees and 0 to 20 ISI.,,,
"However, there is one outliner that has an ISI of 56.1 and a temperature of 21 degrees with a residual of -21.53 degrees.",,,
"Since the data sample is relatively large and the effect of outliers is minimal, we can conclude that this linear regression model is valid for the positive correlation between temperature and ISI.",,,
This discovery may alert firefighter authorities to be extra careful during high-temperature seasons and closely track the forest's condition.,,,
"This study focused on the relationship between the cause, effect, and frequency of forest fires.",,,
We found out that August and September are the months where forest fires happen the most often.,,,
"To investigate the cause of this frequency, we explored the relationship between Drought Code and month of year and temperature and month of the year.",,,
We found out that both August and September have high drought codes and high temperatures.,,,
"Therefore, we could conclude that there are positive correlations between drought code and frequency of fire and temperature and frequency of fire.",,,
"In the last research question, we also examined the effect of temperature on the initial speed of fire.",,,
The correlation between these two factors is reasonably linear and positive.,,,
"For further future studies regarding forest fire data, it would be beneficial to include forest fire locations since different locations have various environments and weathers.",,,
"If location data is provided, the analysis could be more specific and accurate.",,,
This study could help firefighting authorities enhance their knowledge regarding the different causes of forest fire and potentially increase monitoring and supervision during those times to prevent large damage.,,,
