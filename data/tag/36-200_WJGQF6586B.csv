Introduction Health Insurance debates have been prevalent in the United States for centuries.,,,
"Insurance is used to provide guaranteed coverage for patients who experience unexpected loss, disease, death, and etc.",,,
There has been controversy over whether the premiums hinder or benefit U.S. citizens.,,,
"In fact, patients who suffer with heart diseases incur more expenses from their insurance due to the disease.",,,
Our goal in this study is to analyze the correlation between the cost of the insurance for patients with heart disease and their medical history amongst different variables.,,,
This study may contribute to improving insurance rates for those with existing conditions.,,,
"Data We used the ISLE, Integrated Statistics Learning Environment, data toolbox to conduct this study.",,,
We were given information on a sample of 788 Health Insurance subscribers from January 1998 to December 1999.,,,
"We drew our attention to the cost, a quantative variable that measures the price of the insurance premiums.",,,
"For females, the average cost for insurance premiums was $2867.35 while the average cost for insurance premiums for males was $2572.31.",,,
"As you can see, the female to male ratio is extremely high so we chose not to use gender as a variable in this study, but instead focus on the cost overall.",,,
"We chose to analyze the relationship between cost and three other variables: drugs, age, and complications.",,,
"The variable drug is a categorical variable that categorizes the number of drugs prescribed to the patient (0 if none, 1 if one, and 2 if two or more).",,,
The variable age is a quantitative variable that measures the subscribers’ age by years.,,,
The mean for the average age for n=788 was 58.718 years while the standard deviation for the age of the subscribers was 6.754 years.,,,
"The variable complications is a categorical variable that measures whether or not the subscriber had complications with the heart disease treatments (0 if no, 1 if yes).",,,
Research Scenario Relationship between Cost of Insurance and the Amount of Drugs Prescribed Our first research question is to determine whether the amount of drugs a subscriber is prescribed have an effect on the price of insurance.,,,
"Typically, insurance companies increase prices for drugs, but if someone constantly uses drugs, they can afford it, or it is compensated by the insurance premiums.",,,
"Therefore, we hypothesize that an increase in the amount of drugs prescribed to a subscriber will increase the cost of premiums.",,,
We use a bar chart (figure 1 below) to analyze the relationship between the number of drugs prescribed and cost.,,,
"Based on the data conducted in the bar chart above, where drugs, the explanatory variable, and cost, our response variable, we observed that as the number of drugs prescribed increases the more the cost for premiums increases.",,,
"The average cost for 0 drugs is $2,223.64, the average cost for 1 drug is $4,323.02, and the average cost for 2 drugs or more is $5,226.94.",,,
"Therefore, we can conclude that there is an association between the cost and the number of drugs prescribed which confirms our hypothesis.",,,
Relationship Between Cost of Insurance Premium and Age Our second research question is to determine whether the age of a patient with a heart disease affects the cost of insurance premium rates.,,,
"Based on anecdotal evidence, we hypothesize that the older the patient is, the higher the cost for insurance premium is.",,,
We began by conducting evidence using a scatterplot that shows cost and age (figure 2 below).,,,
"In this scatterplot, age was the explanatory variable while cost was the response variable.",,,
We observe that insurance premium rates will be higher for patients above the age of 40.,,,
"Within the scatter plot, it suggests that there is some relationship between age and the cost of insurance premium rates.",,,
"A heart disease patient who is 24, pays $277.4 while a heart disease patient who is 65, pays $52.6649k.",,,
"We could postulate that insurance companies hold older people more accountable because the older a patient is, the more they are exposed to unexpected accidents, therefore, they are expected to pay higher insurance premium rates.",,,
"However, we can not conclude that there is an association between age and cost of insurance premium.",,,
"There must be a lurking variable because if we focus on the line of regression, we do not see an ascending linear line.",,,
"The line of regression does not necessarily show a correlation, but the older a patient is, the more clustered the data is around higher insurance premium rates.",,,
"Hence, our hypothesis was neither proven or unproven; more information is needed to draw a conclusion.",,,
Relationship between Cost of Insurance Premium and Complications Our last research question will focus on whether complications within the treatment or the person affect the cost of insurance premium rates.,,,
"Since we know that insurance companies increase the premium rates and add on extra costs in the realms of unexpected accidents, it is more than likely that complications will increase insurance premium cost.",,,
We used a box plot (see figure 3) to analyze the correlation between the cost and the number of times complications occurred.,,,
"As we can see in the data above, there were 745 heart disease patients without complications while there were 43 patients with complications.",,,
"If the sample was random, then we can possibly conclude there are more heart disease patients without complications.",,,
There is a significant difference in sample size.,,,
"Thus, our hypothesis is somewhat proven because the patients with 1 or more complications, on average, had a higher cost for insurance premium, but we are uncertain if the data is reliable.",,,
"Discussion Our analyses focused on the cost of insurance premium rates, and we examined potential relationships with drugs, age, and complications.",,,
"Overall, we found that the more the number of drugs prescribed increases the more the cost for premiums increases.",,,
We observe that insurance premium rates will be higher for patients above the age of 40.,,,
"However, we can not conclude that there is an association between age and cost of insurance premium because more information is needed to draw a conclusion.",,,
We determine there must be a lurking variable such as unexpected accidents patients who are older than 40 years get into.,,,
"There was a significant difference in the cost of insurance premium rates and complications, but it is not safe to conclude that there is an association between the two variables.",,,
The data for complications and cost is bias.,,,
This study may be beneficial to heart disease patients who need insurance.,,,
It seems plausible to dive deeper and conduct research with a larger sample size that is generalized to the entire population in the United States.,,,
Future researchers should consider increasing the sample size and focus on other lurking variables to strengthen our hypothesis.,,,
