Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
"Technology is growing at an exponential rate, and as time passes, more and more people are considering the idea of starting a business and becoming their own boss",Context,,,Intro,
The overall population has begun to accept passive income practices and wants to take advantage of the virtual space,Context,,,Intro,
One way upcoming entrepreneurs are starting to make a living online is through the well-known app Youtube,Context,,,Intro,
"Specifically, people are looking into the best paths to starting a career in this virtual space",Context,,,Intro,
"Therefore, our goal in the current work is to understand better what factors/categories and conditions lead to a successful youtube presence",RQDef,,,Intro,
This work may help adults and adolescents who want to share a passion they have with the world but don’t know the necessary knowledge to see if they can bring in a large following,RQSig,,,Intro,
Data,Title,,,Data,
"We have information on a sample of 1259 Youtube Channels, gathered by Social Blade and containing data up to the end of 2018",DataDesc,,,Data,
"Our main focus will be on the variable Category, a categorical variable indicating what content is posted on the channel",DataDesc,,,Data,
"Entertainment is the most popular Category (517 Channels, compromising 40.3% of the total sample size of 1259), and the Sports category was the least popular (23 Channels, compromising 1.83% of the full sample size of 1259)",DataStat,DataDesc,,Data,
Our research questions also includes Countries and Subscribers,DataDesc,,,Data,
"The variable Country is a categorical variable showing which locations on earth are most famous for each type of Category ( America has the most significant amount of categories out of all Counties except for music, which India holds)",DataStat,DataDesc,,Data,
Subscriber is a quantitative variable measuring the number of followers a specific channel has (calculated on a person-by-person basis),DataDesc,,,Data,
"the mean amount of subscribers was 3,201,757, and the Median was 1,949,612",DataStat,,,Data,
Our first research question is to distinguish the number of channels by category,RQDef,,,RS,
"Since Youtube’s main purpose is to entertain the world, we believe it to be reasonable to hypothesize that the entertainment category would have the greatest amount of channels followed by the gaming category",HypDef,HypJust,,RS,
We also hypothesize that the News and Politics category will hold the least amount of channels because a good amount of people read the news and don’t exactly watch it,HypDef,,,RS,
"Beginning with the all-categories piechart (figure 1, below), we see that most of the channels in this study were entertainment-based and were followed by music",ResDesc,MethDef,,RS,
"(We could assume that because a more significant number of people listen to music every day, compared to the number of people who play video games, this dispute could make sense.)",IntImp,,,RS,
"We also see that News and Politics hold the second-lowest ranking, the lowest being sports",ResDesc,,,RS,
"(This could be partly due to individual channels having the high majority of sports news and entertainment content, which makes the barriers of entry extraordinarily high.)",IntImp,,,RS,
"Further reviewing the Channel Categories, it can be seen that the top 4 categories make up 76.7% of the total of all of the channels in our sample size: this means that the five fewest amount of categories make up 23.31% or, on average, 4.66% each",ResDesc,IntVar,,RS,
This would mean that the entertainment sector alone holds about ten times as many channels as the average of the lowest five categories,IntVar,,,RS,
Our following research question is to examine the arrangement of categories within various countries,RQDef,,,RS,
"Since Youtube was founded in the United States, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that the United States would hold the most significant number of channels and categories within this country",HypDef,HypJust,,RS,
Therefore we believe that America will prove to be the leader in all nine categories within our study,HypDef,,,RS,
"We graphically investigate the relationship between Country and Category with a Bar Chart, as shown in figure 2, below",MethDef,Struct,,RS,
"From the Bar Chart shown above, we can see that the United States does indeed hold the greatest amount of channels in all the categories, except for the Music Category: which is dominated by India",ResDesc,,,RS,
"At the same time, we can also tell that apart from the United States, India, and Great Britain all other countries’ representation seems to be fairly small",ResDesc,,,RS,
"Overall, we can see that most youtube channels in this study are from the United States, followed by India and Great Britain, therefore we can somewhat assume that you would have a slightly higher probability of becoming more successful on youtube if you originate/start your account in one of these countries",IntImp,ResDesc,,RS,
Our third research question is to review whether there is a relationship between category and subscribers and identify the relationship if there is one,RQDef,,,RS,
The number of subscribers that a specific category has can prove to be important in the context of which categories are best to enter as a new content creator(The categories that have the most subscribers should lead to a quicker pace of increasing subscriber count),RQSig,,,RS,
"Simultaneously, we would hypothesize that categories with fewer subscribers would be harder to gain a following because they would not show much interest",HypDef,,,RS,
"We can create a scatterplot with categories and subscribers: as illustrated in figure 3, below",MethDef,Struct,,RS,
"In figure 3 shown above, we plot the categories against the subscribers, to see if there is a relationship between the number of subscribers a group has, and what category the specific group is in",MethDef,,,RS,?
"We can assume that although entertainment was the most popular category, representing over 40% of the entire sample size, this does not make it the best avenue to go into in order to gain a quick following",HypDef,,,RS,??
There is no direct relationship between the category that someone decides to get into and the growth of their channel,IntVar,,,RS,
The data shows a wide variation and the boxplots are fairly similar,ResDesc,,,RS,
Therefore we do not have enough evidence to prove that there is a relationship between the category of a channel and the speed at which the subscriber count will increase,IntVar,,,RS,
We can also look at the Median and Mean values to further investigate why our hypothesis is flawed,MethDef,,,RS,
(See Table 1 Below),Struct,,,RS,
"In Table 1 shown above, we calculated the Mean and the Median values for subscriber count of each of the 9 categories that we are studying",MethDef,Struct,,RS,?
We see that the entertainment category does not have the greatest mean or median,ResDesc,,,RS,
"Therefore, through the previous two data examples that have been shown, there is in fact no relationship between how fast your channel grows and which category someone decides to get into",IntVar,,,RS,
(More data is needed in order to completely prove or disprove this point.),LimData,,,RS,
"Our investigation focused on Categories for a sample of 1259 Youtube Channels, gathered by Social Blade and containing data up to the end of 2018, and explored potential relationships with Countries and Subscriber Count",DataDesc,,,Discuss,?
"Overall, we found that if an upcoming entrepreneur wants to enter the youtube space, they should know that youtube overall mainly consists of entertainment, music, and gaming",IntImp,ResDesc,,Discuss,
"Therefore, there is more of an audience for these categories than someone wanting to join the sports category, which has the fewest channels and therefore would probably have high entry barriers",IntImp,ResDesc,,Discuss,
"We also noticed that most big channels in this study were from the United States, India, and Great Britain, which gives us a glimpse of where potential individuals with a slight interest in Youtube might want to know",ResDesc,IntImp,,Discuss,
"Due to these three countries having the greatest amounts of channels, the content created is essential so that new creators can imitate what they are doing",IntImp,ResDesc,,Discuss,
"So, for example, through the data, you could take away that events and trends that are going on in these countries will possibly show up a lot in the search engine and therefore might lead to more views and subscribers for those who can capitalize on the opportunity",IntImp,,,Discuss,
"Lastly, we saw that the exact category you post on is not the major contributor of earning a mass following: it seems that what causes a greater subscriber count is keeping up with the trends that are going on in the world, specifically in the more well-known areas and creating content that a large mass of people are swarming to learn about",IntImp,ResDesc,,Discuss,
"Overall, our analysis can help individuals who plan to start a career in the youtube world, obtain a small advantage, and entertain as many people as possible",RQSig,,,Discuss,
