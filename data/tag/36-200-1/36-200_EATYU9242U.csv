Introduction,Title,,,Intro,
It is no secret how integrated social media is in our everyday lives,Context,,,Intro,
"As the era of technology continues to grow, so do the different ways people can start to profit off of it",Context,,,Intro,
"One social media platform, YouTube, is extremely well known for being expansive across the globe and paying their creators",Context,,,Intro,
Creators are those who produce content and get paid for it,Context,,,Intro,
"Channels can even get paid five figures per year, and this number grows more than 50% year by year",Context,,,Intro,
This video-sharing platform is the second most popular social network and has over 2 billion users world-wide,Context,RQSig,,Intro,
"As the number of people joining YouTube increases, our goal is to analyze which channel category is the most popular",RQDef,RQSig,Context,Intro,?
Those hoping to find a career in it would find it most beneficial to discover which category is the most popular,RQSig,,,Intro,
Studying this may be useful for those who are thinking of joining YouTube and would like to gather information about the most popular creators,RQSig,,,Intro,
Data,Title,,,Data,
"We analyzed statistics from 1,259 YouTube channels up until the end of 2018",DataDesc,,,Data,
All information was collected by Social Blade,DataDesc,,,Data,
"Our main focus is a channel’s category, a qualitative variable that is user-defined and describes the channel topic",DataDesc,,,Data,
"The most common category was Entertainment (with 517 channels, categorizing 41% of the total channels), while the least common category was Sports (with 23 channels, compromising 1.83% of all the channels)",DataStat,,,Data,
"These numbers can be found in table 1, below",Struct,,,Data,
Our questions will thus incorporate the number of subscribers and views,DataDesc,,,Data,
"The quantitative variable subscribers, pertains to the number of subscribers a channel has",DataDesc,,,Data,
"The highest number of subscribers for a channel was 27,765,423 ( TheEllenShow ) whereas the channel with the lowest number had 107,329 (FORTNITE IS MY CL)",DataStat,,,Data,
"There was a mean of 3,201,757.576 subscribers and a standard deviation of 3,556,605.298",DataStat,,,Data,
Views is a quantitative variable that measures the total views across all the videos a channel has,DataDesc,,,Data,
"The biggest view count was 245,118,098,041 (Ryan ToysReview), while the least number of views was 593,861 (fouseyTUBE)",DataStat,,,Data,
"There was a mean of 1,346,843,185.938 views and a standard deviation of 2,036,809,998.695 views",DataStat,,,Data,
Distribution of YouTube Channel Categories,Title,,,RS,
"For the first research question, we decide to analyze the distribution of categories among all the channels and see how we can characterize them",RQDef,,,RS,
Our initial hypothesis is that the category Music will be the most frequent one and then News & Politics will be the least frequent category,HypDef,,,RS,
We chose Music as the most frequent because we assume that many artists/record companies create channels in order to gain exposure and release music videos for fans,HypJust,,,RS,
"We chose News & Politics as the least frequent due to the assumption that people tend to watch news on TV channels, (especially local news) rather on YouTube",HypJust,,,RS,
"Starting with the frequency bar graph of categories (figure 1, below), we observe that the most frequent category is Entertainment",ResDesc,Struct,,RS,?
"There are more than 500 channels that categorized themselves as Entertainment (count of 517), whereas Music comes in second with almost 200 channels (count of 204)",ResDesc,,,RS,
Maybe this category seems the most general and is the most alluring to creators that do not know what to label their channel as,IntImp,,,RS,
"An alternative assumption is that instead of record labels viewing their content solely as Music, they may categorize their channels as Entertainment",IntImp,,,RS,
"Further examination of the results displays Sports as the least frequent category, with less than 50 channels (count of 23) and News & Politics coming in as second last with less than 50 channels (count of 46)",ResDesc,,,RS,
"We can argue that because official sport games are aired live on TV for free, there wouldn’t be a reason to create many channels to air games",IntImp,,,RS,
"According to the data presented in the frequency bar chart (figure 1), as well as in our frequency table for categories (table 1), our hypothesis cannot be supported",IntVar,,,RS,
Popular Channel Categories have more Subscribers,Title,,,RS,
Our second research question is to see if their is a relationship between categories and subscribers and characterize if there is one present,RQDef,,,RS,
We hypothesize that the channels labeled with the frequent categories have more subscribers than the channels labeled as the least frequent categories,HypDef,,,RS,
"The more channels there are under one category, the better chance that that specific category will have more subscribers compared to a category that has a lesser count since there are more channels to subscribe to",HypJust,,,RS,
The higher frequency of one category increases its’ chances of getting more subscribers,HypJust,,,RS,
"We assume then by this reasoning, that because the Sports category is the least frequent out of all, it will also have the the least number of subscribers",HypDef,,,RS,
This then means that the Entertainment category will have the most number of subscribers because it was the most frequent category,HypDef,,,RS,
"From the table above, we can see that the category with the biggest mean of subscribers is Comedy, not Entertainment",ResDesc,Struct,,RS,
"The smallest mean is News & Politics, not Sports",ResDesc,,,RS,
We can also see that there is indeed variation between the means of the subscribers for the categories,ResDesc,,,RS,
"To then test the relationship between subscribers and category graphically, we use a side-by-side boxplot diagram (figure 2 below)",MethDef,Struct,,RS,
"Although we see some slight differences in the means and medians for subscribers given by category, the variation displayed is sufficiently large and the different boxplots sufficiently similar that we do not have sufficient evidence to back up our hypothesis and state that there is a relationship between the number of subscribers and the channel’s category",ResDesc,IntVar,,RS,
Popular Channel Categories have more Views,Title,,,RS,
Our third research question is to see if their is a relationship between categories and views and characterize if there is one present,RQDef,,,RS,
We hypothesize that the channels labeled with the frequent categories have more views than the channels labeled as the least frequent categories,HypDef,,,RS,
"The more channels there are under one category, the better chance that that specific category will have more views compared to a category that has a lesser count",HypJust,,,RS,
"We say since there are more channels under the most frequent category, this also means that there are more videos uploaded which allows for a higher view count",HypJust,,,RS,
The higher frequency of one category increases its’ chances of getting more views,HypJust,,,RS,
"We assume then by this reasoning, that because the Sports category is the least frequent out of all, it will also have the the least number of views",HypDef,,,RS,
This then means that the Entertainment category will have the most number of views because it was the most frequent category,HypDef,,,RS,
"From the table above, we can see that the category with the biggest mean of views is Music, not Entertainment",ResDesc,Struct,,RS,
The smallest mean is Sports,ResDesc,,,RS,
We can also see that there is indeed variation between the means of the views for the various categories,ResDesc,,,RS,
"To then test the relationship between category and views graphically, we use a side-by-side boxplot diagram (figure 3 below)",MethDef,,,RS,
"In this figure, the boxplots distributions look very similar, in terms of outliers and slight median differences",ResDesc,,,RS,
"The distributions are sufficiently similar, that we do not have enough evidence to back up our hypothesis and state a valid claim that there is a relationship between category and views",IntVar,,,RS,
Discussion,Title,,,Discuss,
"Our research analysis concentrated on the qualitative variable Category for a sample of 1259 YouTube Channels, examining relationships (if any) with subscribers and views",DataDesc,RQDef,,Discuss,
The most popular category was Entertainment and the least popular was Sports,ResDesc,,,Discuss,
"Overall, we did not find a strong relationship between category and subscribers nor views",ResDesc,,,Discuss,
"Our analysis does have limitations, such as the fact that certain YouTube channels were excluded due to the fact of their popularity and such high extreme numbers ( ex: PewDiePie, gaming channel with second highest number of subscribers)",LimAna,,,Discuss,
"Future analysis should also include how drastic events in society may influence the amount or type of content uploaded, age demographics of these channels, screen time of the subscribers, and especially asking Social Blade the salary and wages of these channels",FuWork,,,Discuss,
"Knowing this extra information plus our analysis can help creators who want to get paid for uploading videos see how all these variables tie together and help guide their YouTube career- whether this be choosing a category to influence their content, show how there are no relationships between category and subscribers as well as category and views which can help if they don’t think their chosen/favorite category is not as popular as others",RQSig,,,Discuss,
