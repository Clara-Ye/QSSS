"Introduction: According to the CDC, heart disease was the number one cause of death in the United States in 2019 (https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/leading-causes-of-death.htm).",,,
"More than 650,000 people died to heart disease, which is 4 times as many deaths than those who died due to accidents.",,,
Services to treat these patients can be very expensive.,,,
"That’s why health insurance companies base their premiums on the patient’s age, medical history, and other lifestyle choices.",,,
"In this study, we will look at the relationship between the cost of claims and the patient’s attribute to better assess what factors affect cost the most.",,,
Data: The data has been collected from 788 insurance subscribers from the claim period of January 1998 to December 1999.,,,
Graph 1: The primary variable is the claim cost.,,,
It is a quantitative variable that measures how much money each patient filed for during the claim period.,,,
"The least amount of money claimed was $0 and the most was $52,664.90.",,,
"The mean cost was $2,999.57, the median cost was $507.20, and the standard deviation was $6,690.26 as seen in Table 1.",,,
"In Graph 1, we see that the data is skewed to the right.",,,
This shows us that the higher costs could potentially be outliers and a lower cost is more common.,,,
"The following research questions will include the analysis of variables such as age, duration of treatment, and gender.",,,
Graph 2: Age is a quantitative variable.,,,
"As displayed in Table 2, the average age of this study is 58.7 years old while the median age is 60 with a standard deviation of 6.75 years.",,,
"In Graph 2, we notice that the data is slightly skewed to the left with potential outliers being on the younger end of the spectrum.",,,
Graph 3: Duration is also a quantitative variable.,,,
Table 3 tells us that the average duration of stay is 164 days while the median duration of stay is 165.5 days.,,,
The standard deviation is 120.9 days.,,,
"Based on Graph 3, we can see that the data is very spread out with no outliers.",,,
This explains why the mean and median are so close to each other.,,,
"Graph 4: Gender is a categorical variable, with the options being either male or female.",,,
The overwhelming majority of the participants are female while only 180 are male as seen in Table 4 and Graph 4.,,,
"As we get older, our body ages, making it more prone to injury and disease.",,,
Those who are older are more likely to need more medical care than the younger generations.,,,
"Because of this, we can hypothesize that as people with heart disease get older, the cost of healthcare will increase and therefore their claims will also increase.",,,
"Graph 5: Based on Graph 5 we see that while the younger participants seem to incur less cost, there isn’t a direct correlation between claim cost and age.",,,
"When we add a line of best fit, we see that it actually slopes downward pointing to a decrease in claim cost as age increases.",,,
"However, because the data points are so random, it’s safe to say that our hypothesis is incorrect and there is not a linear relationship between claim cost and age.",,,
"Graph 6: Similarly to the previous hypothesis, we predict that the longer a participant is treated for their disease, the higher the claims cost will be.",,,
In Graph 6 we see that this is barely the case.,,,
The linear fit is a minor positive slope and that those with short treatments still incurred heavy claim costs.,,,
Graph 6 is even more scattered than Graph 5.,,,
Graph 7: Our last research study is much different than the previous ones.,,,
"Unlike the previous two, there are no clear factors that would show that men or women are more likely to incur high claims.",,,
"However, we decided to see if the costs would increase based on gender to examine potential sexism in costs.",,,
"However, we acknowledge that this is not the most accurate hypothesis because there is a large disparity in the numbers of men and women in the study.",,,
"Because there are more women, the data will be a little more accurate compared to men.",,,
"As you can see in Graph 7, men had a higher median claim cost, but women had a higher upper limit.",,,
This could be because the women had a higher set of outliers than men.,,,
This data set leads to a very unclear analysis and therefore doesn’t prove or disprove the hypothesis.,,,
"Discussion: Our analysis of claim cost used a sample of 788 insurance users with heart disease over the claim period of January 1998 to December 1999 and analyzed the relationship between age, duration of treatment, and gender against cost of claims.",,,
"Overall, we found that none of the variable led to a clear cause and effect relationship with the cost.",,,
"It seemed that no matter the age, duration, or gender, costs were very even across the board.",,,
"It’s possible that there are other variable that can point to causation and correlation, but none within the study pointed to a clear relationship.",,,
Future analysis would potentially include looking into the relationships between comorbidies and interventions.,,,
"Ideally, we would collect data on weight and diet as those factors can also affect heart disease.",,,
