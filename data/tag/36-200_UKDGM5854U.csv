Introduction: As stated by the OECD: “the average length of stay in hospitals (ALOS) is often used as an indicator of efficiency.” (https://data.oecd.org/healthcare/length-of-hospital-stay.htm) Shorter hospital durations result in less expensive billing for patients and increased profit for hospitals; allowing the patient to re-enter society more efficiently.,,,
Our goal in the current work is to examine the association between certain determinants and the duration of hospital stays.,,,
This work may be helpful for hospitals in improving the turnaround rate for its patients or for insurance companies to base people’s premiums in a more cost efficient and regulated manner.,,,
Data: We have information from a sample of 788 subscribers to a health insurance company from January 1998 through December 1999.,,,
"Our central focus will be on the variable duration, a quantitative variable measuring the number of days patients spent in hospitals.",,,
The mean duration was 164.030 and the standard deviation of duration was 120.916.,,,
Our research questions also included comorbidities and complications.,,,
The variable comorbidities is a quantitative variable indicating a patients pre existing medical condition or disease prior to hospital admittance.,,,
The mean of comorbidities was 3.766 and the standard deviation of comorbidities was 5.951.,,,
The variable complications is a categorical variable indicating whether or not the patient had sustained some form of medical complication during their visit.,,,
The mean for patients with no complications was 161.792 and the mean for patients with at least one complication was 202.814.,,,
Research Question 1: Characterizing the Duration of Hospital Stays Our first question pertains to describing the distribution of duration.,,,
From a subjective assumption we hypothesized that most hospital stays last around four days.,,,
"By utilizing the histogram below, we notice that the outlier between 0 and 7 days indicates a small majority of hospital visits ending within that range.",,,
"(We could assume that general trips to the hospital are non-life threatening, resulting in a swifter turnaround rate for the discharge process; future studies may be conducted to validate this claim.)",,,
The distribution of duration shows multiple modes with a strong outlier between 0 and 7 days.,,,
"With the exception of that one outlier, the data is uniformly distributed with no skew.",,,
It is generally symmetrical.,,,
The average duration was around 164 days and has a large standard deviation (relative to the mean) of 120.916.,,,
The median duration was 165.5 days meaning that more than half of the patients spent at least 165 days in the hospital; refuting our initial hypothesis of 4 days.,,,
The interquartile range of duration spans from a 25th percentile of 41.500 days to a 75th percentile of 281.00 days.,,,
"Since only 25% of the days spent in the hospital were below 41.5 days, there is further evidence that our initial hypothesis was not supported by the data.",,,
Research Question 2: Duration Dependant on Complications Our next research question is to ascertain if there is an association between complications and duration and elucidate the association if there is one.,,,
"Since medical complications such as improper treatment plans or complications during surgery require additional medical attention, it is reasonable to hypothesize that complications would elicit longer hospital stays.",,,
We first summarize the duration of hospital length by the occurrence of a complication.,,,
This is shown below in the first table.,,,
The summaries in table 1 show that the average duration is slightly higher for those who sustain complications than those who don’t.,,,
We utilized side by side boxplots to further explore the relationship between complications and duration as shown in Figure 2 below.,,,
Research Question 3: Duration Dependant on Comorbidities Our third research question is to investigate whether there is a relationship between comorbidities and duration of hospital stay and to interpret the relationship if there is one.,,,
Comorbidities are medical conditions or diseases that patients have irrespective of their trips to the hospital.,,,
"Due to the ramifications of comorbidities- specifically their impact on immune systems, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the possession of comorbidities can be associated with a longer duration of hospital stays.",,,
Patients with preexisting health concerns may require special modifications to their treatment plans demanding longer periods of hospitalization.,,,
Discussion Our analysis focused on duration of hospital stays for a sample of 788 subscribers (from a health insurance company) from 1998-1999 and examined potential relationships between comorbidities and complications.,,,
We found that typical hospital visits possess a large range of days between 0 and 379 with a slight majority ranging from 0-7.,,,
We did not see a strong relationship between complications and duration due to the similarities of means in the data.,,,
Nor did we observe a strong relationship between comorbidities and duration due to the sporadic nature of the scatterplot.,,,
Potential limitations and difficulties pertained to the relatively small sample size of our data set.,,,
Future analyses might include a larger data set to include samples with patients who sustained a higher number of medical complications or possessed a greater number of comorbidities to discern an association between variables.,,,
We would have liked to observe a more diverse sample size to strengthen our understanding of the associations.,,,
Future studies may use these analyses as a foundation to establish more specific relationships that help hospitals and insurance companies improve their turnaround rates and insurance premiums.,,,
