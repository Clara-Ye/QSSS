"In the summer of June, 2017 in Portugal, sixty-six people died due to the Pedrógão Grande fire that spread over the land.",,,
"Two-hundred fifty-three were injured; four-hundred eighty-five houses, destroyed; twenty-thousand hectares of land with incalculable numbers of wildlife, blackened into soot.",,,
"* So much lost in the mouth of flame, its preventability deepening the tragedy with each instance.",,,
"Our goal in our current work is to reduce future fires through greater prevention efforts, by understanding what variables increase the probability of fire occurrence and severity.",,,
"We will work with data from Portugal where fires occur often, with great severity, on land with lots of diverse and threatened wild flora and fauna.",,,
"This research could be of help to present and future land stewards, in Portugal and perhaps around the world, to decrease the destruction caused by fire brought to land and to all its inhabitants.",,,
We have a sample of forest fire data collected from the Montesinho natural park in the Northeast region of Portugal.,,,
This data was collected from January 2000 to December 2003.,,,
"In our analysis, our primary focus will be on the velocity of the fire spread, measure by the variable Initial Spread Index or ISI, a numerical rating.",,,
"The mean rating for ISI in our dataset is 9.022; the median, 8.400; and the standard deviation, 4.559.",,,
"We will also be using the categorical variable of the month of the year that the fire took place, as well as the quantitive variables of area burned in hectares, and the Fire Fuel Moisture Code (FFMC).",,,
The FFMC rating measures the moisture content of sticks and other inorganic materials on the ground of the forest.,,,
"FFMC and ISI are elements of the Fire Weather Index, which, along with the date of the fire in our dataset, were recorded by an inspector in Montesinho.",,,
"Beginning with the frequency table for the number of fire occurrences by the months of the year, we observe that most of the fires take place within two months.",,,
"The distribution of the months was highest in August and September, with 184 in 172 fires respectively, as seen in Figure 1.",,,
"As for the distribution of the area burned, as seen in the histogram of Figure 2 below, there exists a strong screw to the left.",,,
"While the mean area burned was 12.895 hectares, the median is only 0.520 hectares.",,,
There is a large standard deviation of 63.646 hectares.,,,
"From this, we gather that most of the fires in Montesinho natural park are relatively small, while only a few creating the majority of the damage to the land.",,,
"As for FFMC, the mean rating was 90.645, the median 91.600, and standard deviation 5.520.",,,
"Our first research question will be to characterize the distribution of fire occurrences through the months, as well as the fire’s velocity, as measured by ISI.",,,
"Based off of anecdotal evidence from the fires in California, we suspect that there may be a season in which a majority of the fires occur; we also hypothesize that the months with the greatest concentration of fires will also have greater ISI measures.",,,
"We reason this might be the case, because there may be lurking variables connected with the seasons that might cause fire to more quickly spread at one time of year versus another.",,,
Perhaps this would be related to the temperature and average rainfall given each month or season of the year.,,,
"As Figure 1 above indicates, most of the fires took place in August and September.",,,
"Analyzing the frequency table, we find that the fires in August and September account for 68.9% of total fires in a year.",,,
"This supports our hypothesis, as there exists a strong relationship between the time of year and the frequency of fires.",,,
"Fire occurrences are heavily concentrated, rather than occurring evenly across the year.",,,
"Next, we analyze whether there is a relationship between ISI each month, by creating box plots of ISI measurements each month, and comparing them side by side, in Figure 3 below.",,,
"Overall, we do see some small differences in ISI as the month changes.",,,
"We do have enough evidence to say that there is a slight relationship between the ISI and time of the year, though the variations are sufficiently similar that there is not enough evidence to say there is a relationship between ISI and the exact month.",,,
Our second research question will investigate whether FFMC is a strong indicator of the velocity the fire travels (ISI).,,,
"We speculate the higher the FFMC, the higher the ISI.",,,
"This is because, we venture that lower the moisture content of the top layer of inorganic material, the higher the FFMC.",,,
"Therefore, a forest with a high FFMC would quickly ignite, and thus spread a fire faster across land.",,,
"In the above figure, we observe that there is a positive, strong, non-linear association between FFMC and ISI.",,,
"The shape of the data is heavily skewed to the right, with a few outliers to the far left, before 80 FFMC.",,,
"Overall, there seems to be a correlation between a higher FFMC, and a faster speed of the fire.",,,
"Especially after an FFMC value of around 85, the speed of the fire increases dramatically as the FFMC increases.",,,
"In our research question, we will investigate whether higher ISI has a relationship with the amount of area the fire ultimately covers.",,,
"We are interested in understanding if the fire’s speed, and the fire’s total area are related, and postulate that the faster fire travels, the more severe the fire, and the more land damaged as a result.",,,
"As we observe in the scatterplot, Figure 5, above, the regression line is flat, indicating that there is no relationship between ISI and the amount of the land area that gets burned.",,,
"Future analysis may look for other factors that contribute to the severity of the land that is lost in forest fires, like perhaps wind speed or the density of bodies of water in an area that may help contain the fire.",,,
"Our analysis focused on the distribution of fire occurrences over the year, as well as the measurement of their ISI.",,,
"We also looked into ISI’s relationship to FFMC, and area burned.",,,
"Overall, we found that there are months where the amount of fires is greatly concentrated, especially in August and September.",,,
"We found that, as FFMC increased, there was an exponential increase in fires, especially past a threshold of 85.",,,
"This indicates that to prevent more fires in the future, FFMC should be closely monitored, with attention given when the rating is upward of 85.",,,
"Because our data is observational, we cannot make conclusions about causation.",,,
"Future analysis might include analyzing the effectiveness of interventions to mitigate FFMC, or clear up forest litter with controlled fires.",,,
"We also found that in our data there was no relationship between ISI and the area of the fire, indicating that the severity of the fire and speed are not related.",,,
"This data may be slightly compromised depending on whether there were any fire relief efforts, or efforts to stop the fires while this data was collected, which would minimize the relationship between area and ISI.",,,
Perhaps the fires that spread the fastest are also the ones in which relief efforts are already targeted the fastest.,,,
"In all, our analysis can help land stewards who struggle with the destruction caused by fires.",,,
"It may enable them to understand what variables to monitor closely in order to prevent damage by fires, and protect both their loved ones and their natural environment.",,,
