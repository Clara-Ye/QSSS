"INTRODUCTION The greater occurrence of forest fires can be credited alongside an increase in global temperatures, directly as a result of climate change, where the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere due to excessive human activity has caused variations in weather patterns and more greenhouse gas emissions.",,,
"Essentially, this means that the environment, as well as the populations that exist within it (whether human or animal), are even more susceptible to certain environmental damage and ruination connected to forest fires.",,,
"This is synonymous to the recent situation in Oregon in 2020, where the wildfire season had caused catastrophic fires throughout the state, as referenced here: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/22/oregon-2020-fire-season-smoke-coronaviruus.",,,
"Therefore, from this analysis, we will seek to interpret whether or not certain environmental aspects have a direct effect on the occurrence of forest fires, and if these aspects can be influenced beforehand.",,,
"Furthermore, this work might aid meteorologists and environmentalists in developing newer, more effective wildfire detection technology in hopes of warning the general public before said event is expected to happen.",,,
"DATASET The primary source of data for this research was derived from a sample of 517 forest fires received from the inspector of the Montesinho Natural Park in Portugal, as well as the Braganca Polytechnic Institute and collected from January of 2000 to December of 2003.",,,
"The main variable from this data that we will be examining is the area (measured in hectares), where the mean value of damage was approximated to be 12.90 ha and the median was 0.52 ha.",,,
"As a quantitative variable, this piece of data will measure how extensive wildfires occurred within a given area.",,,
This variable will be supplemented by examining the area in relation to the month that each wildfire occurred (August being the highest month with 184 forest fires and November being the lowest with only 1).,,,
"Along with the month, we will look at the temperature of which each fire was incited, and the lack of moisture in deep, organic layers or the Drought Code.",,,
"While the month of a wildfire can be described as a categorical variable, the other variables of temperature (as measured in Celsius) and Drought Code are quantitative.",,,
Relationship Between Month and Occurrence of Forest Fires Our first research question involves determining whether or not there’s a relationship between the amount of forest fires and the month that they appear to happen in.,,,
"For instance, it’s not expected that forest fires are to occur in months that signify colder seasons.",,,
"Therefore, we hypothesize that most of the wild fires that have taken place are within the months of March to early August, where spring and summer are more present.",,,
"In Figure 1, we can see that the months with the highest values in terms of wildfires was August and September, which, so far, is similar to our previous hypothesis.",,,
"To add, our interpretation is furthered in Figure 2 below, mainly because the months that received the most wildfires, and therefore the most damage of area in terms of hectares, were also the months of August and September.",,,
"Therefore, this demonstrates that the areas that received heavy wildfire damage included fires that took place primarily in August and September, with a few exceptions in March and July, the next highest values respectively.",,,
"And more than half of the recorded wildfires occurred within the months of March to August, which gives further reasoning behind our earlier statement that most of the fires to take place would be within these months, where dryer seasons are present.",,,
"Thus, from this we can conclude that our initial supposition was supported by the data.",,,
"This ultimately shows that the month has some relationship with when certain wildfires occur, as well as how long they burn.",,,
Forest Fires Dependent on Temperature Our second research question requires us to examine whether or not temperature is relevant to the amount of area burned by a forest fire.,,,
"From this data, we hypothesize that higher temperatures will lead to areas of greater damage from forest fires, mainly because increased temperatures are most likely to symbolize a hotter, dryer environment.",,,
"And if hotter temperatures seem to exist for a particular day, in a month that’s more susceptible to wildfires, then meteorologists will be able to better anticipate when a wildfire is more likely set to happen, thus improving the chances that the population has to prepare.",,,
"In the scatter plot below (Figure 3), the temperature in which each wildfire happened was plotted against the area burned.",,,
"From this plot, we can tell that the distribution between temperature and area has a left skewness, seeing that the values tend to thin out going towards the left.",,,
"This means that more of the distribution is centered to the right hand side of the plot, where higher temperatures are related to higher areas burned by the forest fires.",,,
"We can also see that the plot includes 2 outliers, where their values of burned area are significantly higher than the linear fit.",,,
"And since the linear fit appears to be straightforward with most of the values in the distribution, we can conclude that as temperature increases, the area potentially burned by a forest fire increases alongside this as well.",,,
"This is further supported in the following regression table (Table 1): Our last research question requires us to determine what effects the Drought Code, lack of moisture within deep, organic layers, might have on the consistency of forest fires.",,,
"In examining this variable, It will be useful to consider that areas with lower Drought Codes have relatively more moisture.",,,
"Therefore, we hypothesize that burned areas are more vulnerable to previous higher Drought Codes, and are ultimately more susceptible to wildfires.",,,
"In the plot below, the distribution shows the Drought Code in relation to area.",,,
"Here, the distribution appears to have only two outliers (both high values of area burning and Drought Code), and the plot’s skewness is towards the left: Furthermore, we can tell that the bulk of the values reside where the Drought Code is relatively high, meaning that the area burned as a result of the wild fires is greater.",,,
"The same trend can be seen in some of the smaller values in the plot as well, where the burned area wasn’t as great primarily because the Drought Code was smaller.",,,
This shows that the dryness of organic material has some influence as to whether or not a forest fire has the ability to commence.,,,
"DISCUSSION Overall from this analysis, we have found that in the sample of 517 forest fires in Portugal, there seem to be definite relationships with numerous variables related to wildfires.",,,
"Within each examination, we found that the month ( in essence, time of year) can potentially influence whether or not a forest fire occurs, merely by utilizing previous anecdotal evidence of seasons that are normally associated with certain months, in this case, summer being the primary one.",,,
We can also conclude that temperature does have a direct correlation with the amount of wildfires that populated the sample.,,,
"This means that higher temperatures, while they cannot be changed by human intervention, can be predicted and thus prevent unpreparedness.",,,
"And lastly, we found that the Drought Code and lack of adequate moisture of organic material common to forests can affect the vulnerability of a specific area to wildfires.",,,
"In all, these results can demonstrate to meteorologists and forests preservationists that some specific elements that cause wildfires can be either predicted or controlled to some extent.",,,
"One factor that I would consider in a newer research analysis would be finding more relevant data accustomed to more recent wildfires, especially pertaining to the ones in Oregon.",,,
"I think that analyzing this data, keeping in mind that temperatures and other variables have changed since the years of 2000 and 2003, would most likely give more relevant results in today’s discussion of forest fire preparedness.",,,
"Ultimately, improving these factors would increase the chances of survival and adaptation for human and animal populations in the future and in other studies.",,,
