Introduction: Technology has served as a communication medium to strengthen the world’s interconnectedness throughout the past decade.,,,
"While Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter have all served to catalyze industrial growth in developed countries, some have questioned whether these same trends are seen in Youtube’s streaming platform.",,,
"More specifically, our goal is to discover whether people in more developed continents are more likely to have higher subscriber and total viewer counts than those in less developed continents.",,,
The Medium conceptualizes Stanford University Research on continental development which finds that Europe and Asia are more developed than Africa (https://medium.com/mother-afrika/why-has-africa-been-less-developed-than-europe-and-asia-throughout-human-history-a95c027acb07).,,,
"Therefore, for purposes of the study, Europe and Asia will be considered developed and Africa will be less developed, with Oceania and the Americas falling somewhere in the middle.",,,
This data might be helpful for Youtube influencers looking to grow their subscriber base and views in specific continents.,,,
"Data: We have data on a sample of 5 continents, collected by Isle (https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/36-200-A,B,C,D,E,G-spring21/youtube_project1/).",,,
"Our primary variable will be on the focus of continent, a categorical variable measuring the continent of origin of a given Youtube channel.",,,
"There are five continents grouped in this experiment: Europe, Asia, Americas, Oceania, and Africa.",,,
The Americas have the highest total count of Youtube channels (634) and Africa has the lowest total count of Youtube channels (16).,,,
"Of all the continents averaged together, the mean is 251.8 channels and the standard deviation is 237 channels.",,,
"The frequency table and bar chart (Table 1 and Figure 1, respectively) display the channel count by continent through different methodologies.",,,
Both confirm that the Americas have the highest Youtube Channel count and Africa has the lowest Youtube Channel count out of the continents.,,,
"Our research questions [as stated in the next section] will also include Youtube Subscribers, a quantitative variable measuring the total number of people who have subscribed to a given channel.",,,
"The mean Youtube Subscriber count for the different continents are as follows: Africa: 2103884.7, Americas: 3478715.8, Asia: 2805615.9, Europe: 3215550.3, Oceania: 3200091.7 subscribers.",,,
"The standard deviation Youtube Subscriber count for the different continents are as follows: Africa: 1052329.9, Americas: 3864320.5, Asia: 3148050.5, Europe: 3447235.4, Oceania: 2865033.6 subscribers.",,,
The histograms (figure 2) show the relationship between subscriber count and frequency in given continents.,,,
"In the Americas, the graph is skewed to the right and is unimodal.",,,
"Europe, Oceania, and Asia are similarly skewed to the right and are unimodal.",,,
"Africa, however, is skewed to the left and is bimodal.",,,
"Because Africa is the least developed continent, our research questions will delve into whether there is a relationship between continental development and Youtube subscriber/view count.",,,
"From the above data, we can extrapolate sample statistics of subscriber count in each continent.",,,
The table then conceptualizes this data to draw conclusions about the mean and standard deviation as a result of subscriber count in different continents.,,,
"Another quantitative variable that our research questions will use is Youtube Views, a measure of the total views across all videos in a given continent.",,,
"The mean Youtube view count for the different continents are as follows: Africa: 925357540.6, Americas: 1392436237.1, Asia: 1240812529.3, Europe: 1489543847.7, Oceania: 1169130649.2 views.",,,
"The standard deviation Youtube view count for the different continents are as follows: Africa: 509855684.9, Americas: 2143732474.1, Asia: 2027205915.1, Europe: 1810864550.0, Oceania: 1444693380.7 views.",,,
"Africa, the most underdeveloped continent, has the smallest median and standard deviation total view count, possibly showing how a lack of development could hinder Youtube’s views in that continent.",,,
"However, because we cannot account for lurking variables, we cannot assume whether this correlation is solely due to development.",,,
The histograms (figure 3) show the relationship between total views and frequency in different continents.,,,
"Similarly to figure 2, Africa’s bimodal left skew differs from the remaining continent’s unimodal right skew.",,,
"These distributions could be helpful to us later on when drawing conclusions from the research scenarios because all the more “developed” continents follow one trend, while the most undeveloped continent follows another trend.",,,
"From this data, we can extrapolate sample statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of viewer count (table 3) in each continent.",,,
Characterizing the Distribution of Youtube Subscribers in Different Continents The first research question examines the distribution of Youtube Subscribers in each continent with research recorded.,,,
We hypothesize that regions with more developed continents such as Europe and Asia will likely have more Youtube Subscribers than those with less developed continents such as Africa and Oceania.,,,
"Starting with the box plot of subscribers given continent below (figure 4), we observe that the Americas and Oceania have the highest subscriber count, while Africa has the lowest subscriber count.",,,
"The Americas likely have the most outliers, with some values (countries) having over 25 million subscribers compared to the median of 2.1 million.",,,
"The Americas’ interquartile range is extremely high compared to the other continents, totaling at approximately 3.3 million subscribers.",,,
"On the other hand, Africa has far more compressed data with no outliers and an interquartile range of only approximately 2 million subscribers.",,,
Number of Views Dependent on Continent The second research question examines the number of views dependent on each continent.,,,
I hypothesize that nations with a higher subscriber count in a given continent will also have a higher number of views in that same continent because more developed countries will likely have more access to internet.,,,
"Nearly all the continents except for Africa have outliers in their view counts, with the Americas having an outlier and a maximum at 24.5 billion views and Africa having a maximum of only 2.1 billion views.",,,
"Because America’s outlier is likely to skew the data and because America is more developed than Africa (Stanford/The Medium), we believe that more views will be found in more developed continents than in less developed continents.",,,
Number of Subscribers vs Number of Views in Each Continent The third research question examines whether there is a relationship between number of subscribers in a continent and the total number of Youtube views in that continent.,,,
My hypothesis is that there is no relationship between number of subscribers and number of views in each continent because the individual trends between subscribers and views do not show the same correlation compared to continents.,,,
"By conceptualizing data from plot 4 and plot 5 (box plots for research question 1 and 2), the differences in relationships between subscribers and continents and views and continents prompts me to hypothesize that no relationship exists between the two categorical variables.",,,
Plot 6 below shows the relationship between total subscribers and total views in different continents.,,,
"While Africa and Oceania both tend to fall towards the left in terms of views and subscribers, America and Asia seem to follow less of a trend.",,,
"The scatterplot shows the display of two quantitative variables, subscriber count and total viewer count.",,,
"Most of the data tended to concentrate towards the left side of the graph, meaning that most continents had few views and few subscribers.",,,
"All the continents sampled had similar subscriber counts, but Americas and Asia both have some of both the most and the fewest views (they are prominent on both the far left and far ride side of the plot).",,,
"Therefore, there is no relationship between subscribers and views in a given continent.",,,
"Discussion: Our analysis focused on five continents: Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania.",,,
"The research questions then used these continents (categorical variable) to discover its possible relationships with two quantitative variables, subscriber count and total view count.",,,
"While I initially hypothesized that more developed continents (Europe and Asia) would likely have higher subscriber and total viewer counts, this hypothesis was disproven.",,,
"Instead, I found that there was no relationship between continents with higher subscriber counts and development or higher viewer counts and development.",,,
My analysis has limitations in that it does not account for the ambiguity between the classification of continents.,,,
"For example, some people consider North and South America to be separate continents, which could throw off the data in terms of development as well as subscriber and viewer count in that continent.",,,
"Also, different methods of characterizing developed and developing continents could have changed my initial hypothesis.",,,
"For example, one researcher could use different development measures to find that the Americas is more developed than Asia or Europe.",,,
"In the future, this project could go one step further to determine if there is a correlation between continental development and access to the Youtube website.",,,
"To perform this experiment, researchers could center around each continent’s total clicks on the Youtube website to see if there is a trend between more developed continents having higher numbers of clicks.",,,
"From there, we could compare this study (subscribers and views) against the new study (clicks on the Youtube website) to discover what, if any, relationship continental development has with Youtube.",,,
"Overall, our analysis can help researchers learn more about the role of Youtube in different continents.",,,
