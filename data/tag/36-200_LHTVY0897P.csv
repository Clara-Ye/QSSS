Introduction Heart disease poses an omnipresent threat across American lives as millions of new ischemic heart disease conditions are treated every year.,,,
"Although these cases vary in severity from simply requiring lifestyle changes to more critical cases that require major surgery, heart disease necessitates immediate evaluation and treatment from medical professionals as it is one of the leading precursors and causes of death in America (as detailed in https://www.cdc.gov/heartdisease/facts.htm).",,,
"Already costly and rapidly increasing, medical costs throughout the nation are a tough burden to shoulder without the help of medical insurance.",,,
The total costs of these medical insurance claims may have a relationship with insurance subscribers’ medical history throughout the claim period.,,,
"Our goal in this report is to determine the presence of such a relationship in an effort to help medical insurance companies decrease costs by allowing them to identify potential subscribers with ischemic heart disease who may file more costly claims, (in other words, high-risk patients).",,,
"Data In this report, we will be examining data collected from 788 medical insurance subscribers from January 1998 through December 1999.",,,
"We will primarily center our examination of medical insurance claim costs on the variable cost, or the total cost of each subscriber’s claims to their insurance company, in dollars.",,,
"For the claims period in question, the mean cost of claims was $2799.96, with a standard deviation of $6690.26.",,,
"We will also examine the variables comorbidities, age, and gender in relation to the variable of cost for our research questions.",,,
This selection of variables will allow medical companies to screen prospective subscribers prior to their subscription period for high-risk factors.,,,
The variable comorbidities is a quantitative variable which details the number of other conditions the subscriber has in conjunction with heart disease.,,,
"The data for this variable is demonstrated by the histogram (figure 1) below; Total Costs of Claims & Comorbidities: For our first question, we will be determining the possible existence and characterization of an association between the number of comorbidities a subscriber has with the cost of their claims in ischemic heart disease treatment.",,,
"Based on the idea that patients with more comorbidities would likely necessitate more complex treatment than patients whose treatment would be more straightforward, we hypothesize that patients with more comorbidities will file more costly claims.",,,
We can evaluate this hypothesis with a graphical analysis.,,,
"In figure 3 below, the subjects are binned into groups based on the number of comorbidities they have in intervals of 10.",,,
"(No subjects had between 50-59 comorbidities, exclusive.)",,,
"From the boxplots in the above Figure 3, we observe that the medians vary across the six groups above.",,,
The first group ([0-10) comorbidities) has a median cost of $368.,,,
"The next groups’ median costs demonstrated above in succession from left to right are $1682.6, $1876.05, $1525.2, $2011.6, and $2916.8.",,,
We can see that these medians are sufficiently different to suggest some kind of association between the two variables.,,,
We will further examine this association with a scatterplot with a linear regression.,,,
"Although the scatterplot does not seem to be necessarily linear in Figure 4, upon closer inspection of the scatterplot, the data, especially at lower ends of the comorbidities scale, is very dense while there are fewer outliers in the high ranges of cost, making the graph appear less linear.",,,
"However, it is sufficiently linear that we can conclude that this type of visualization is relevant for the data.",,,
There appears to be a positive linear association.,,,
"As comorbidities increase, so does the cost.",,,
"When cost is regressed on comorbidities, the slope is 164.14, further indicating a positive association.",,,
"Furthermore, when the correlation coefficient of comorbidities vs. cost is calculated, it comes out to be 0.146, providing further evidence of a positive association.",,,
Total Costs of Claims & Age: Our next question will involve determining the possible existence and characterization of an association between total cost of claims and age of subscribers.,,,
Age may play a role in the cost of claims as older patients may necessitate more intensive care when being treated for ischemic heart disease.,,,
We thus hypothesize that older subscribers will have more expensive claims.,,,
"In the boxplot above (figure 5), ages were binned into various groups.",,,
(There was no participant under the age of 24).,,,
"Through graphical examination with the box plots in Figure 5, we observe that the median total claim cost varies greatly from the younger groups to the older groups.",,,
"For example, the median total claim cost for 24-30 year olds is $277.40 while the median total claim cost for 50-60 year olds is $526.",,,
We can see that these medians are sufficiently different to suggest some association between the total claim cost and the age.,,,
"To further evaluate this possible association, we can do further graphical analysis.",,,
"FIGURE 6 As shown above (Figure 6) in the scatterplot, in which age is not binned, there is a negative linear relationship between age and cost.",,,
"Although the scatterplot does not seem to be necessarily linear in Figure 6, upon closer inspection of the scatterplot, the data, especially at higher ends of the age scale, is very dense while there are fewer outliers in the high ranges of cost, making the graph appear less linear.",,,
"However, it is sufficiently linear that we can conclude that this type of visualization is relevant for the data.",,,
"As age increases, cost is seen to be decreasing slightly.",,,
"When cost is regressed onto age, we see a slope of -58.19, further indicating a negative association.",,,
"When calculating the correlation coefficient, it comes out to be -0.059, indicating a negative, but very slight, association.",,,
Total Costs of Claims & Gender: Some studies have suggested that males may be more vulnerable to ischemic heart disease than females.,,,
"This may further translate to heavier costs incurred by biological males; if vulnerability to the disease is indeed increased in men, they may experience worse or more complex symptoms, requiring more extensive treatment.",,,
"Based on this idea, we hypothesize that male subscribers incur more costs on their claims than do female subscribers.",,,
We can examine the validity of this hypothesis using graphical analysis.,,,
"Discussion To summarize, our analysis involved data from 788 ischemic heart disease patients’ medical history during a claim period.",,,
We aimed to discover any relationships that may be helpful for medical insurance companies in screening processes for new subscribers.,,,
This information may be helpful for medical insurance companies in creating the best possible payment plans for prospective subscribers.,,,
"By using the variables that we have studied, they can attempt to predict ischemic heart disease patients’ claim costs.",,,
"In doing so, they can trim their expenses, allowing for cheaper services for other clients.",,,
"Our study involved studying gender, age, and comorbidities in relation to the subscribers’ claim costs.",,,
"We were able to determine that there exists a positive association between comorbidities and cost, as well as a negative association between age and cost.",,,
"However, a clear-cut association between gender and cost could not be determined.",,,
"One important thing to note is that this study does not imply causation of higher/lower costs due to comorbidities or age, because the participants were not randomly assigned.",,,
"Instead, this was an observational study which can only determine the existence/characterization of a correlation.",,,
"During analysis, there were also some difficulties in determining if the relationship was linear as the data was very condensed.",,,
Future analyses may include family and social history.,,,
"Factors such as unhealthy diet, smoking, and parental history of heart disease are great contributors to the osnet of ischemic heart disease, and examining these factors in screening potential subscribers will surely be valuable to insurance providers.",,,
