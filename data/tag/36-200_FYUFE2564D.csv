"Introduction: As we adapt to using more technology in our day-to-day lives, streaming services such as Youtube, have become extremely popular.",,,
"Since life in the 21st century revolves around social media, I thought that there would be some interesting relationships to observe between Youtube’s statistics and its success as a platform.",,,
"After a couple of months from its founding date in 2005, it was able to skyrocket in popularity, going from attracting around 30,000 views per day to 25 million views per day (Britannica *) Seeing this platform grow so rapidly raises the question of what in the app brings so much success.",,,
Is it the content uploaded?,,,
The number of subscribers a content creator has?,,,
"With these questions in mind, I will be studying different variables that present themselves on this platform and extracting how they contribute to its success (along with the success of a channel).",,,
"Data Set: In this study, we will be comparing data points provided by Social Blade, an analytics website that provides content creators with statistics about their channel.",,,
The information provided is from the Social Blade statistics of 1259 channels up until the end of 2018.,,,
"Primarily, we will be observing the variable views, a quantitative variable that accounts for the total views of each channel.",,,
"As seen in Table 1, the mean of total views is 1,346,843,185.938 views, and the Standard Deviation of total views is 2,036,809,998.695 views.",,,
"My study will additionally focus on the variables account age, video uploads, and subscribers.",,,
Account age is a quantitative variable that counts how many weeks a channel has existed on Youtube (noting that this was measured until the end of 2018).,,,
"In Table 2, the mean account age was 305.056 weeks, and the standard deviation was 173.080 weeks.",,,
Video Uploads is also a quantitative variable that counts how many videos each channel in this sample has uploaded.,,,
"Looking at Table 3, we see that the mean video uploads were 4,4460.103 videos, and the standard deviation was 13,608.006 videos.",,,
"Lastly, subscribers is a quantitative variable that counts how many subscribers each channel has on Youtube.",,,
"As seen below in Table 4, the mean subscriber amount is 3,201,757.576 subscribers, and the standard deviation is 3,556,605.298 subscribers.",,,
"Research Scenarios: Before analyzing the relationship between variables, it important to know how the histogram of the number of views looks like and behaves.",,,
"Before looking at the data and scatterplot, I hypothesized that there would be a pretty distinct relationship between views and subscribers.",,,
"Specifically, I expected views to increase as a channel gained subscribers.",,,
"However, it’s not as clear of a relationship as I once thought.",,,
"After looking at the scatterplot, you can see that as subscribers increase, views increase as well.",,,
"But there are some pretty clear exceptions, such as one point that has a little over 10 million subscribers but has a substantially low amount of total views.",,,
"There are also extreme outliers in the substantially high category, such as one point that has some amount of subscribers around 15 million but has a total of almost 25 billion views.",,,
"The relationship here definitely exists, but it doesn't take into account that the algorithm can pick up random videos to make extremely viral.",,,
"Regarding which line would best fit, neither really work well but the smoothed fit would be better than the linear fit.",,,
"When looking at Table 5, it is clear that the scatterplot is somewhat sporadic because the correlation value comes out to be 0.767, which signifies that this data set has somewhat of a strong positive correlation.",,,
Is there a meaningful relationship between views and account age?,,,
"My hypothesis for this relationship was similar to my predictions in the first part, which was that I expected there to be a clear-cut relationship between account age and views.",,,
"But once again, I was proved to be somewhat wrong.",,,
"It seems that it’s difficult to tell if the older or younger an account (age) is, the more or fewer views it will get.",,,
"The one trend that is somewhat observable towards the middle of the plot is that the older the account (age), the more views it obtains.",,,
(With the exception of the 25 billion to 200-week old account outlier).,,,
"If I were to choose a fit that would better represent the data on the scatterplot, I would choose the smoothed fit (although both do not seem to fit this graph well).",,,
"Before working through the data, I predicted that the more videos (upload) a channel uploaded, the more views they would obtain.",,,
"However, I was proven wrong.",,,
"By looking at Figure 3, it seems that the fewer videos a channel (video) uploads, the more views they get.",,,
"After looking at the plot and considering why that could be, I realized that videos that have more time put into their production (meaning it takes longer, hence causing a channel to upload less), probably attract more viewers because the video is more visually appealing or better executed.",,,
Discussion & Conclusion: This analysis revolved around data points from 1259 Youtube channels from their creation to the end of 2018.,,,
"With this information, we discovered that i.)",,,
"the fewer videos a channel uploads, the more likely it is they get more views (depending on the quality of the video as well as Youtube’s algorithm), ii.)",,,
"that the older an account is, the more views it is likely to obtain, and iii.)",,,
"the more subscribers a channel has, the more probable it is they will get more views.",,,
"However, it is important to note that the relationship for ii and iii are a lot harder to observe than i because there was a lot of variation in the data.",,,
"Additionally, there are other factors that need to be considered (such as Youtube’s algorithm, as in what length of videos it prefers, and what different age groups are gravitated to watch on this service.)",,,
These relationships might become clearer in the future if they are observed from different counties within a state/ states within a country/ or countries within a continent.,,,
"With that being said, the information provided above can give content creators and brands who want to utilize the platform Youtube an idea of what they should do in order to gain an audience and collect views, hence succeeding on the platform.",,,
