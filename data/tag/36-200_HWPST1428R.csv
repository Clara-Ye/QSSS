Introduction: The amount of created Youtube channels is increasing daily.,,,
"As of 2020, there was more than 37 million Youtube channels and about 500 hours of video is uploaded every minute.",,,
"(as reported in Tubics, A., & Tubics, C. , November 19, 2020: https://www.tubics.com/blog/number-of-youtube-channels/#:~:text=As%20of%202020%2C%20there%20are,hours%20of%20video%20every%20minute.)",,,
Our goal in the current work is therefore to better understand how some youtube channels have high number of subscribers.,,,
Data: We have information on a sample of 1259 Youtube channels.,,,
"Our primary focus will be on the variable subscribers, The number of subscribers to the channel.",,,
"Our research questions will also include the relationship between category and subscribers, the association between video uploads and subscribers.",,,
In addition to the relationship between subscribers and views.,,,
Our first question will be to see the relationship between category and number of subscribers.,,,
"Beginning with the bar chart of youtube channels categories (Figure 1, below), we observe that ‘Entertainment’ is the category with the highest number of subscribers (approx.",,,
1.5 Billion).,,,
"We also notice that ‘Music’ is the second highest category, where it has approx.",,,
710 Million subscribers.,,,
"According to the data in the bar chart, ‘Entertainment’ and ‘Music’ are the categories with the highest amount of subscribers which can somewhat indicate that youtube users/viewers mostly are interested in videos that would entertain them such as watching prank videos or listening to music (through streaming music videos).",,,
Our next research question is to investigate whether the number of subscribers is associated with the number of videos uploaded by the channel and characterise the association if there is one.,,,
"Since viewers are likely to return to Youtube and watch newly uploaded videos, it seems reasonable to hypothesize that there might be an association between number of videos uploaded and subscribers.",,,
"In the scatterplot (Figure 2, below), we have used subscribers in the x-axis and videos uploaded in the y-axis.",,,
"In this scatterplot, we will be mostly focusing on 2 categories (Entertainment and Music).",,,
"From the scatterplot in figure 2, above, we first notice that there is a cluster on the left, it indicates that when a channel has a small number of video upload it tend to have more subscribers than a channel that uploads more videos for both entertainment and music categories.",,,
We also notice that entertainment category has some outliers.,,,
These outliers indicate that some Youtube channels may have a high amount of video uploads and still have a high number of subscribers.,,,
"Overall, although we have some outliers across the scatterplot, we have enough evidence to say that uploading more videos is not associated with having more subscribers.",,,
Our third research question is to investigate whether there is a relationship between views and subscribers.,,,
Views is an important element in every youtube channel.,,,
Here we assume that having a high number of subscribers is associated with having a high number of views.,,,
"However, in some cases, a youtube channel could lose its subscribers (i.e: due to a scandal) and that would lead its videos to have high number of views but low number of subscribers.",,,
"In the scatterplot, (Figure 3, below), we have used subscribers on the y-axis and views on the x-axis.",,,
We are focusing on 2 categories which are the entertainment and music.,,,
"From the scatterplot in figure 3, above, we notice that there is a cluster on the left which indicates that videos who have higher views usually get more subscribers.",,,
"However, we also notice some outliers for the entertainment, where there is some videos that gets approx.",,,
24 Billion views and the channel would have 16 million subscribers.,,,
We then build a regression model between views and subscribers.,,,
We can notice that there is a positive relationship between the subscribers and views.,,,
As the number of subscribers increase and the numbers of views also increase.,,,
"Discussion: Our analysis focused on the amount of subscribers for a sample of 1259 youtube channels, we mostly focused on 2 categories (Entertainment and Music) which had the highest amount of subscribers and the data included a sample of 721 youtube channel within these 2 categories.",,,
"Overall, we found that youtube channels that are within entertainment or music categories tend to have a higher number of subscribers than other categories.",,,
"We did not see a strong relationship between video uploads and subscribers due to the variation, which indicated that it is not necessary to have high number of subscribers for a youtube video that have a high number of uploads.",,,
We noticed a relationship between subscribers and views where there was a positive relationship between the subscribers and views.,,,
"In the future, we might consider analyzing a specific youtube channel in the Music category where we can notice what attracts the subscribers and views.",,,
"Overall, our analysis can help both youtube channel moderators and viewers to understand what to categories to focus on when starting a new channel or uploading a new video.",,,
